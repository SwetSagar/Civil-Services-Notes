## Disintegration of Maratha's Reasons

- [x] #todo
- **Inept Leadership** : M were despotic dependent on personality and character of head of state. No settled constitution. BR II was criminal in character, BR I himself went to sign Treaty of Bassein accepting subsidiary alliance. Daulat Rao Sindhia was not worthy successor to Mahadji Sindhia.

```ad-Views

 **Sardesai** : Their misdeeds brought Poona court and society to moral degradation that no ones life, property or honour was safe. 

```

- **Inherent defects of Maratha State** :

```ad-Views

**Jadunath Sarkar** : at no time did they make any concerted attempt at well thought out organised communal improvement, spread of education or unification of people. Their cohesion was not organic but artificial.

```

- **Absence of stable economic policy** : After war w/ Aurangzeb M peasants took up arms. State mostly depended on plunder for revenue viz Chauth and Sardeshmukhi. Civil war among leaders and Famine in 1804 took heavy toll on life. Leaders had to mortgage territories to bankers. There was no foreig trade or industry War became their National Industry
- **Weakness of Political Set-up** : Was a loose confederation. First the Peshwa usurped the power of Chattrapati then Subordinate War Lords did the same w/ Peshwa. They set up semi independent kingdom. Irreconciliable hostility b/w them viz Sindhias and Bhosles was detrimental. Mutual Jealousies among them was common.
- **Inferior Military System** : In Organisation, war weapons, discipline, effective leadership. Centrifugal tendencies -> frequent treacheries. Motives of M soldiers were no higher than personal interest. Neglect of Cavalry affected mobility.

```ad-Views

 **Alfred Lyall** : abandonment of Guerilla warfare was cardinal mistake

```

- **Superior English Diplomacy** : Before wars EIC wanted to win allies and isolate enemies diplomatically. Ex in 2nd Anglo Maratha war English won over Gaekwad, Peshwa and other Maratha Jagirdars.
- **Superior English Espionage** :

```ad-Views

**Sardesai** : Marathas knew very little about the England, their govt, factories, character, arms and armaments.

```

- **Progressive Outlook of the English** : Indian still wedded to old dogmas and notions. Very little care given for scientific inventions, oceanic voyages or acquisition of colonies. Marathas cared more about religious merit ang distribution of gifts to Brahmins. Entire IN outlook was medieval

```ad-Views
**JN Sarkar** : Growth of orthodoxy and Brahmin Maratha diff sapped vitality of the state. 

**GW Forrest** : Jealousy from various causes b/w M chiefts and Brahmins would prevent union of whole empire

```ad-Answer

You are correct, my apologies for the mistake. The Treaty of Bassein was actually signed by Bajirao II, the last Maratha Peshwa. The treaty was signed on December 31, 1802, and under its terms, the British East India Company recognized Bajirao II as the ruler of the Maratha territories in western India and promised to provide him with military and financial assistance in return for certain concessions against the Holkars. The treaty marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the British East India Company and the Maratha Empire and increased the company's responsibilities in western India.

The British responsibilities in India increased, as they now had to manage a much larger area and population. This was a major challenge for the British, as they had to manage a complex and diverse region with different political and cultural dynamics. The treaty also had a significant impact on the economy of the region, as the British now had access to a much larger market and resources. Overall, the Treaty of Bassein in 1802 was a major turning point in the history of British India, as it marked the beginning of British dominance in the region.

```ad-Answer

The Anglo-Maratha relations in the first two decades of the nineteenth century were largely characterized by conflict and war. After the death of the Peshwa Baji Rao II in 1818, the Maratha Confederacy was weakened and the British saw an opportunity to expand their influence in the region. In 1818, the British signed the Treaty of Poona with the Marathas, which allowed the British to station troops in the Maratha territories and to collect taxes from certain areas. This treaty was seen as a betrayal by some of the Maratha leaders and led to the First Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1818).

The British were victorious in this war and, in 1819, the Treaty of Nagpur was signed, which ceded large portions of Maratha territory to the British. This treaty further weakened the Maratha Confederacy and led to the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1818). During this war, the Marathas were able to put up a strong resistance, but ultimately they were defeated by the British.

The ultimate defeat of the Maratha power by the British was largely due to the superior military and technological capabilities of the British as well as the disunity among the Maratha leaders. The Marathas were also unable to match the British in terms of resources and manpower. Furthermore, the British were able to exploit the internal divisions within the Maratha Confederacy and use them to their advantage.

```ad-Answer

The statement you provided is a subjective opinion and whether the treaty of Bassein was wise, just and politic measure depends on the perspective from which it is viewed.

From the perspective of the British East India Company, the treaty of Bassein was likely seen as a wise, just and politic measure. The treaty allowed the company to gain recognition as the dominant power in western India, as well as gain control over certain territories and rights. Additionally, the company's financial and military assistance to the Maratha Empire, in return for these concessions, would have been seen as a way to secure its interests in the region.

However, from the perspective of the Maratha Empire, the treaty of Bassein may not have been seen as a wise, just and politic measure. The treaty marked the end of Maratha's dominance in Western India and ceded territories and rights to the British East India Company. Additionally, Maratha Empire had to rely on the company's military and financial assistance, which may have been seen as a loss of sovereignty.

```ad-Views

Some historians view the treaty as a significant victory for the British East India Company. For example, historian J.F. Richards writes in his book "The New Cambridge History of India: The British Empire in India" that the treaty "gave the Company control over the western littoral and access to the hinterland of Gujarat and Malwa." He also notes that it "also established the Company as the paramount power in western India."

Similarly, historian P.J. Marshall in his book "The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire" writes that the treaty "gave the East India Company control over the western littoral and access to the hinterland of Gujarat and Malwa, as well as over the islands of Salsette and Elephanta." He also notes that the treaty "established the Company as the paramount power in western India."

On the other hand, some historians view the treaty as a significant defeat for the Maratha Empire. For example, historian John Keay in his book "India: A History" writes that the treaty "marked the end of Maratha pretensions to paramountcy in western India." He also notes that the treaty "ceded to the British the islands of Salsette and Elephanta and established the East India Company as the paramount power in the region."

In the same line, historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones in her book "The Marathas 1600-1818" writes that the treaty "marked the end of Maratha pretensions to paramountcy in western India." She also notes that the treaty "ceded the islands of Salsette and Elephanta to the British and established the East India Company as the paramount power in the region."

```ad-Answer

The British East India Company took a number of steps to curb the threat of the Pindaris in India. One of the main steps was to launch military campaigns against them. The British also sought to negotiate with the Pindari leaders and offered them financial incentives to disband their bands and return to a peaceful life.

The British official who played a key role in the process of curbing the Pindari threat was Governor-General Lord Hastings. He was the one who initiated the military campaigns against the Pindaris and also sought to negotiate with their leaders. Under his direction, British officers such as Major-General John Malcolm, Major-General Sir William Henry Sleeman and Major-General James Willoughby Gordon were appointed to lead the campaigns against the Pindaris.

Some of the important battles against the Pindaris include:

-   The Battle of Kirkee in 1817, which was fought between the British East India Company and the Pindari leader, Amir Khan. The British emerged victorious and Amir Khan was forced to negotiate a treaty with the British.
-   The Battle of Asirgarh in 1818, which was fought between the British East India Company and the Pindari leader, Daulat Rao Scindia. The British emerged victorious and Daulat Rao Scindia was forced to negotiate a treaty with the British.
-   The Battle of Mahidpur in 1818, which was fought between the British East India Company and the Pindari leader, Sindhia. The British emerged victorious and Sindhia was forced to negotiate a treaty with the British.
