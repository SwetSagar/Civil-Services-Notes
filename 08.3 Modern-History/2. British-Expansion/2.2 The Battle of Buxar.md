```ad-Views

**GB Malleson** : Not only did it advance the frontier to Allahabad it bound the rulers of Awadh to the conqueror by ties of admiration, gratitude, reliance and trust. 

**Alfred Lyall** : English were drawn into connection with upper India and were brought out upon a scene of fresh operations that grew rapidly.
