[ROBERT CLIVE](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Clive)

## Clive's 2nd Governorship of Bengal

- sent after he led victory at Buxar to consolidate rule.
- Was concerned about political system of North and degraded moral character of EIC servants affecting trade.

### Political Settlements

#### Settlement with Awadh and Shah Alam II

![[2.2 The Battle of Buxar#Treaty of Allahabad]]

- Nawab also entered an offensive defence treaty to send help when Company needed.
- Clive did not annex them as it would have put an obligation on EIC to protect a large fronteir.
- Awadh became a buffer state, both the Emperor and Nawab became a great friend of the Company

#### Settlement of Bengal/ Dual System

![[3.1 Early Administrative Structure#Dual system of Government]]

- The power practically lay with the EIC. They appointed 2 deputy diwans Reza Khan for Bengal and Raja Shitab Roy for Bihar. Reza Khan also acted as Deputy Nazim.
- Both the Nizamat and Diwani functions were exercised by Indian agencies while real power rested w/ EIC

##### Clive's Justification of Dual System

- open assumption of authority might have united some Indian princes against EIC -> war.
- French, Dutch, Danes would start paying duties on trade with this new settlement since new firman would supersed older ones
- Open assumption would also complicate England's diplomatic relations w/ France, Hollan, Portugal and Sweden -> anti-British alliance. It would also bring British parliaments direct interference in EIC matters.
- EIC did not have trained personnel to take over and run adm work.
- CoD opposed acquisition of territories that could cause interference w/ trade and profit.

##### Ill Effects of Dual System

- Adm of law and order virtually broke down. Dacoits and Sanyasi raiders roamed freely. George Cornewall in 1858 called this systems(1765 - 1784) more corrupt, more perfidious and more rapacious to ever exist on face of the Earth.
- Agriculture was laid to waste. Revenue give to highest bidder. Over-assessment and harshness in collection accompanied by famine in 1770.
- Agricultural depression, Issue of Dastaks -> virtuall monopoly of English merchants. Clive said that EIC traders traded as sovereigns of land and took the bread out of the mouths of thousands of merchants who formerly traded.
- Weaving industry received setback as silk industry in Bengal was discouraged. Weavers compelled to work in Silk factories to export raw silk who later cut off their thumbs. William Bolts tells that Gomasthas or Companies agents flogged, fined, weavers. Made them forcibly sign contracts and transferred them from one merchant to others like slaves.
- Moral degradation of society. Farmers worked only for those hours that was absolutely necessary, weavers also did the same since there was no incentive for work.

### Administrative Reforms

1. **Civil reforms**
	- compelled EIC servants to sign covenants prohibiting acceptance of presents. Forbade private trade for thema and made payment of internal duties obligatory.
	- Society of Trade was formed w/ monopoly of trade in Salt, betelnut, Tobacco. Profit form these were to be divided among servants on the basis of their ranks -> was soon abolished in 1767.
2. **Military Reforms**
	- Reduction of double bhatta or field allowance. Now only to be paid for service outside Bengal and Bihar.
	- White brigades at Allahabad and Monghyr decided to resign in masse. Their resignation was accepted they were arrested and tried.

### Estimate of Clive

- He was charge by British parliament for exacting illegal presents, he joined the general plunder by organising the Society of Trade.

```ad-Views
collapse: open

**Percival Spear** : Clive was a harbinger of the furture who revealed some of the possibilities that might come. He was forerunner of British Indian Empire

**KM Pannikar** : 1765-1772 the Company estd a robber state. British imperialism showed its worst side. Clive failed to rise as a statesman.

**Lord Macaulay** : His 2nd visit to India dates the political ascendancy of the English in this country far exceeding any pro-consul of rome

**Alfred Lyall** : High spirited, couragious, indefatigable man. English are indebted for foundation of their Empire to him.

**Nandalal Chatterji** : Changes he brought only worsened the situation; evils of inland trade remained incorrected, further aggravated scarcity of silver. System he laid down was short sighted opportunism that reveals his failure to rise to heights of a statesman.

```ad-Answer

The Battle of Buxar, fought in 1764, is often considered one of the most decisive battles ever fought in India. There are several reasons why this battle is considered so significant:

1.  It marked the end of the British East India Company's struggle for control of Bengal: The British East India Company had been engaged in a series of conflicts with local rulers in Bengal for several years, but the Battle of Buxar marked the end of this struggle and solidified British control over Bengal.
    
2.  It marked the beginning of British rule in India: The victory at Buxar marked the beginning of British rule in India, as it allowed the British to exert significant influence over the rest of India and use its resources for their own gain.
    
3.  It marked the end of the Mughal Empire: Buxar was the last significant battle in which the Mughal Empire was able to put up a resistance against the British East India Company, and it marked the end of the Mughal Empire as a significant political and military power in India.
    
4.  It marked the beginning of the British consolidating power in India: The victory at Buxar allowed the British to consolidate their power in India, and they were able to expand their control over other regions of India through military conquests and political maneuvering in the following decades.
    
5.  It marked a turning point in the European powers competition for control of India: The British victory at Buxar over the combined forces of the Nawab of Bengal, the Nawab of Awadh, and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, was a significant blow to the French East India Company which had been competing with the British for control of India.
