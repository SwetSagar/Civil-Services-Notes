### Annexation of Sindh as a Sequel to Afghan War

- Napier believed it to be the tail of Afghan storm
- PE Roberts has called it morally and politically a sequel of Afghan war
- Annex done for strategic puroposed to build defence against Russo-Persian designs -> this was validated in a letter that was written by Lord Auckland to British resident in Sind
- Amirs were coerced to provide finances, bases etc for Afghan War. Various treaties were forced on them to meet the changing situation on it.
- Failure in the war gave reason to fortify frontiers and British prestige due to the loss has suffered greatly. Thus to demonstrate England's strength and re-establish her prestige steps were taken

```ad-Answer

After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839, the Sikh Empire soon began to decline. The death of Ranjit Singh left the kingdom with no strong leader and the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan, the British East India Company and the Khalsa Army all competed for control of the kingdom.

The Durrani Empire of Afghanistan, under the leadership of Dost Mohammad Khan, invaded the kingdom in 1837 and captured Peshawar. The Khalsa Army, led by the Sikh generals, fought against the Afghans and ultimately defeated them in 1838. However, the Khalsa Army soon began to fracture and the British East India Company saw an opportunity to expand its empire. In 1846, the British launched the First Anglo-Sikh War and defeated the Khalsa Army. The Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848-1849 was even more disastrous for the Sikh Empire and the British annexed the Punjab region.

```ad-Answer

The North West Frontier policy of the British in India referred to the strategy employed by the British government in dealing with the various tribes and kingdoms along the northwest border of British India (now Pakistan and Afghanistan). The policy aimed to maintain stability and control over the region, which was seen as a potential threat to British rule in India. The policy included a combination of military force, diplomacy, and administrative control. 

The British also employed a system of "Forward Policy" which included the establishment of forts, outposts and military garrisons in the region to deter tribal raids and incursions into British India. The British also tried to win over the support of local leaders and tribes through the use of subsidies and other incentives. However, the policy was not without controversy, and it was met with resistance from the local population, leading to several uprisings and conflicts.

```ad-Answer

The major considerations of the British imperial power that led to the annexation of Punjab were:

-   Fear of Russian expansion into India and the need to secure the northwest frontier
-   Economic interests, such as control of Punjab's agricultural wealth and access to its trade routes
-   Political instability in Punjab, which was seen as a threat to British rule in India
-   The desire to expand British territorial control and maintain dominance over other European colonial powers in the region.

Charles Napier said this after annexing Sindh in 1943. This statement was made after he annexed the region of Sindh, in 1843, it was not done under the doctrine of lapse but under the justification of 'civilizing' the region as it was under the rule of the Amirs who were seen as unjust and corrupt by the British.

Why it was advantageous and useful 

1.  Control of the Indus River: The annexation of Sindh provided the British with control over the Indus River, which was a key transportation route and a source of irrigation for the region. This control allowed the British to regulate trade and commerce in the region, and to increase their economic and political power in the area.
    
2.  Strategic Location: Sindh was strategically located on the trade routes between India, Central Asia, and the Middle East. The annexation of Sindh allowed the British to secure these trade routes, and to protect their interests in the region.
    
3.  Access to resources: Sindh was rich in natural resources such as cotton, wheat, and fruits. The annexation of Sindh provided the British with access to these resources, which they could use to support their own economy.
    
4.  Military advantage: Sindh was also strategically important from a military perspective. The annexation of Sindh allowed the British to establish a military presence in the region, which they could use to protect their interests and to project power in the area.
    
5.  Control of local population: The British saw the local Amirs as unjust and corrupt, and the annexation of Sindh allowed them to replace the local government with their own officials, who were more sympathetic to British interests. This gave them more control over the local population and allowed them to implement policies that were more favorable to their own interests.

Why it was a rascal measure

1.  The annexation of Sindh was not based on any legal or moral justification. The British East India Company did not have any right or claim to the province, and they annexed it without the consent of the people of Sindh or the ruling Amirs.
    
2.  The annexation was a violation of the sovereignty of the indigenous people. Sindh had its own distinct culture, history, and identity, and the British had no right to impose their rule on the province without the consent of the people.
    
3.  The annexation caused immense suffering and hardship for the people of Sindh. The British imposed heavy taxes and forced labor on the population, which led to widespread poverty and hardship.
    
4.  The British also introduced a number of changes to the administration and legal system in Sindh, which were detrimental to the local population. They centralized power, restricted the rights of the local population and imposed their own customs and laws on them.

```ad-Answer

The British conquest of Sindh in 1843 can be seen as a political and moral sequel to the First Afghan War, which took place between 1839 and 1842.

1.  Political: The First Afghan War was a major setback for the British in terms of their political and military ambitions in the region. The defeat of the British forces in Afghanistan led to the loss of influence and prestige for the British Empire in the region, and the conquest of Sindh was seen as an opportunity to restore their power and prestige in the region.
    
2.  Moral: The British saw the conquest of Sindh as a moral imperative, they were convinced that they were bringing civilization and progress to the region. They saw the local Amirs as unjust and corrupt, and the annexation of Sindh allowed them to replace the local government with their own officials, who were more sympathetic to British interests.
    
3.  Security: The First Afghan war also showed the British that their Indian territories were vulnerable to attacks and invasions from the neighboring regions, and the annexation of Sindh helped secure their western borders.
