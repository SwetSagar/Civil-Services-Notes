## Objective of Early Nationalists

 - Basic objectives of the early nationalist leaders were to lay the foundations of a secular and democratic national movement,
 - to politicize and politically educate the people,
 - to form the headquarters of the movement, that is, to form an all-India leadership group,
 - and to develop and propagate an anti-colonial nationalist ideology.

### Certain Drawbacks of Early Nationalists

- Failed to understand the character of the colonial state
- Did not carry out anti-imperialist mass struggles.

## Objectives of Early Congress

- The <u>promotion of national unity</u> was a major objective of the Congress.
	- If an overwhelming majority of Hindu or Muslims objected no resolution was to be passed - 1888.
	- wherever Parsis, Christians, Muslims or Hindus were a minority their number in elected council cannot be less than the proportion in population - 1889.
- The second major objective of the early Congress was to <u>create a common political platform around which people could gather and conduct their political activities</u>.
	- This is why Congress was not to take up social reform.
	- All initial activity of the early nationalism was geared towards the consolidation of public opinion.
	- The primary objective was to go beyond the redressal of immediate grievances and organize sustained political activity along the lines of the **Anti-Corn Law League**.
	- create a common all-India national-political leadership.
- WC Bonnerji reiterated that one of the Congress objective was the eradication of race, creed or provincial prejudices amongst all lovers of our country and promotion of intimacy and friendship.
- **Internalization and indigenization of political democracy** based on the doctrine of the sovereignty of people.
- It was organised in the form of a Parliament and rooted **parliamentary democrac**y in India.
- made **maintenance of civil liberties and their extension** an integral part of the national movement.
