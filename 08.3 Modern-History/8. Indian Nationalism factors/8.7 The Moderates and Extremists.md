## Failures and Limitations of Moderates

- Lacked faith in common people and failed to acquire a root among them
- Failed to organise mass movements
- idea of pleas did not bring enough administrative and other reforms and were treated with contempt by the British.
- beliefs and political ideas had become obsolete.
- seen as the weaker link among the nationalists.
- John Morley in 1907 put forward the **policy of repression-conciliation-suppression** aka the policy of **carrot and stick.**
- Moderates led by Pherozshah Mehta thought it to be dangerous to be with the extremists.
- Both the parties were unable to see that the colonial state was negotiating because of the fear of extremists and that the Moderates were the outer defence for the extremists.
- Both failed to gauge the importance of a nationwide mass movement.
