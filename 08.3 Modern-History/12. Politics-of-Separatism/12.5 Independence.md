1. To what extent did the Freedom Movement in India influence the Liberation Movement in Africa? [2014, 10m]

```ad-Answer

The freedom movement in India, led by figures such as Mahatma Gandhi, had a significant influence on the liberation movement in Africa. The non-violent resistance and civil disobedience tactics used by Gandhi and the Indian National Congress served as inspiration for many African leaders and movements fighting for independence from colonial rule.

One example of this is the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, led by Nelson Mandela. Mandela was heavily influenced by Gandhi and the Indian freedom movement, and he adopted many of their tactics, such as non-violent resistance and civil disobedience, in his fight against the apartheid government. Mandela himself has acknowledged that Gandhi's teachings and methods were a source of inspiration for him.

Another example is the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya. The Mau Mau movement, which sought independence from British colonial rule, was influenced by the Indian independence movement and its leader, Jomo Kenyatta, was heavily influenced by Gandhi's teachings. He even traveled to India to meet with Gandhi and learn more about his methods.

Additionally, the Indian independence movement served as an inspiration for many other African liberation movements, such as the Ghanaian independence movement led by Kwame Nkrumah, the Algerian independence movement led by Ahmed Ben Bella, and the Zimbabwean independence movement led by Robert Mugabe, among others.

1. "The Royal Indian Navy Revolt was seen as an event which marked the end of the British rule almost as finally as Independence Day." Explain. [2015, 10m]

```ad-Answer

The Royal Indian Navy Revolt of 1946, also known as the Bombay Mutiny, was a major event in India's struggle for independence from British rule. The revolt began on February 18, 1946, when Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) stationed in Bombay (now Mumbai) refused to obey orders from their British officers. The rebellion quickly spread to other naval bases in India, including Karachi, Calcutta, and Madras. The revolt was led by a number of nationalist leaders.

The revolt began as a result of a number of grievances held by the Indian sailors. These included poor pay, inadequate food and living conditions, and discrimination against Indian sailors in comparison to their British counterparts. In addition, the Indian sailors felt that they were being treated as second-class citizens, and were not given the same opportunities as their British counterparts. As the revolt spread, it gained the support of a number of Indian politicians and members of the public.

The revolt was quickly suppressed by the British authorities, who deployed a number of warships to the region and arrested a number of Indian sailors. However, the incident marked a major turning point in the struggle for Indian independence. It demonstrated to the British authorities that the Indian people were willing to take matters into their own hands in order to achieve freedom from colonial rule. In addition, the incident showed that the Indian people were united in their desire for independence, and that they were willing to take risks in order to achieve it.

The Royal Indian Navy Revolt of 1946 was seen as a major event in India's struggle for independence. It demonstrated the determination of the Indian people to free themselves from British rule, and it marked the beginning of the end of British rule in India. The revolt also helped to galvanize the Indian independence movement and to bring the issue of Indian independence to the forefront of international politics.

The revolt was also seen as a major event in the history of India's struggle for independence. It showed that the Indian people were willing to stand up for their rights and fight for their freedom. The incident also highlighted the importance of unity and solidarity among the Indian people in order to achieve their goal of independence. In addition, the revolt demonstrated the power of peaceful protest and civil disobedience in the face of colonial rule.

1. Explain why the efforts at finding solution to India's constitutional impasse failed during 1942-1946. [2017, 20m]

```ad-Answer

During 1942-1946, there were several efforts made by the British government and Indian leaders to find a solution to India's constitutional impasse, which was the deadlock between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League on the question of India's independence and the future constitutional framework of the country. However, these efforts ultimately failed for the following reasons:

1.  Lack of trust and cooperation between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League: The Congress and the Muslim League had fundamentally different visions for the future of India and were unwilling to compromise or cooperate with each other. This lack of trust and cooperation made it difficult for any constitutional solution to be reached.
    
2.  Communal divide: The communal divide between Hindus and Muslims had deepened during the 1940s, making it difficult for any solution that would be acceptable to both communities. The Muslim League's demand for a separate Muslim state further exacerbated the divide.
    
3.  British government's lack of commitment to Indian independence: The British government was more focused on winning World War II and was not fully committed to transferring power to the Indian leaders. This lack of commitment made it difficult for any constitutional solution to be reached.
    
4.  Political instability: The political situation in India was highly unstable during this period, with the Quit India Movement and other protests erupting across the country. This instability made it difficult for any constitutional solution to be reached.
    
5.  Cabinet Mission Plan failed: The Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, which proposed a federal government for British India, was rejected by both the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. This failure further deepened the communal divide and strengthened the demand for the partition of British India.
