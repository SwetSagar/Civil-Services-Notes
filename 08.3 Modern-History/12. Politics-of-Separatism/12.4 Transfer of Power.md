1. "Lord Mountbatten came with an order to organise retreat, in military parlance an operation." Comment. [1990, 20m]

```ad-Answer

The statement "Lord Mountbatten came with an order to organise retreat, in military parlance an operation" refers to the role of Lord Mountbatten, the last British Viceroy of India, in the withdrawal of British colonial rule from India.

In March 1947, the British government announced that it would grant independence to India, but only if a plan for partition was accepted. The Congress party, led by Jawaharlal Nehru, ultimately agreed to partition in order to prevent further violence and preserve India's unity. Lord Mountbatten was appointed as the last British Viceroy of India and was tasked with overseeing the withdrawal of British colonial rule and the transition to independence.

In this context, "organize retreat" refers to the process of preparing for and carrying out the withdrawal of British colonial rule from India. The phrase "in military parlance an operation" suggests that the withdrawal of British colonial rule was considered a military operation, similar to how an army would retreat from enemy territory. Lord Mountbatten was responsible for overseeing this process and ensuring that it was carried out smoothly and efficiently.

It's worth noting that Lord Mountbatten had a short tenure as the Viceroy of India and he was to oversee the withdrawal of British colonial rule in a short period of time, hence the plan for withdrawal was to be implemented in a hurry and was called "Operation Madhouse". The term "operation" also reflects the urgency and complexity of the task at hand, which was to transfer the power and administration of the British Indian government to the newly independent nations of India and Pakistan.

1. "We are therefore unable to advise the British Government that the power which at present resides in British hands should be handed over to two entirely separate sovereign States." Comment. [2004, 60m]

```ad-Answer

The statement “We are therefore unable to advise the British Government that the power which at present resides in British hands should be handed over to two entirely separate sovereign States” was said in the context of India’s independence. This statement was made by the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946 of the  which was sent by the British Government to India to propose a plan for India’s independence. The Plan was proposed in order to avoid the partition of India into two separate countries, India and Pakistan.

The Plan proposed the establishment of a Union of India which would be responsible for the defense, foreign affairs and communications. It also proposed the establishment of three groups of provinces – Group A, Group B and Group C – which would have autonomy over their respective regions. The Plan also stated that the Union of India would be empowered to make laws related to all-India subjects, while the provinces would have the authority to make laws related to their own regions.

The Plan also proposed that the Union of India and the provinces would be autonomous and sovereign entities. This meant that the Union of India would have the power to make laws for the entire country, while the provinces would have the power to make laws for their respective regions. The Plan also proposed that the Union of India and the provinces would have their own Constitutions and would be independent of each other.

However, the Plan was rejected by the Indian National Congress, the major political party in India at the time, as they wanted a unified India. The Congress argued that the Plan would lead to the division of India into two separate countries. They also argued that the Plan would not guarantee the unity of India and would lead to the fragmentation of the country.

In response to the Congress’s rejection of the Plan, the Cabinet Mission Plan stated that “We are therefore unable to advise the British Government that the power which at present resides in British hands should be handed over to two entirely separate sovereign States.” This statement was made to emphasize the fact that the Plan would not lead to the division of India into two separate countries. The Cabinet Mission Plan wanted to ensure that India remained unified and that the power which was currently in British hands should remain in Indian hands.

The Cabinet Mission Plan’s statement that the power should not be handed over to two separate sovereign states was an attempt to ensure that India remained unified and that the power which was currently in British hands should remain in Indian hands. This statement was made in the context of India’s independence and was an attempt to prevent the division of India into two separate countries. The Plan was ultimately rejected by the Indian National Congress and India was eventually partitioned into two separate countries, India and Pakistan.

Additionally, Lord Mountbatten, the last British Viceroy of India, was the one who suggested the partition of British India into two independent countries in 1947 as a means to solve the political impasse between the Congress and the Muslim League. Furthermore, the British government passed the Indian Independence Act 1947, which provided for the independence of India and Pakistan on August 15, 1947 and it transferred the power from British hands to two separate sovereign states.
