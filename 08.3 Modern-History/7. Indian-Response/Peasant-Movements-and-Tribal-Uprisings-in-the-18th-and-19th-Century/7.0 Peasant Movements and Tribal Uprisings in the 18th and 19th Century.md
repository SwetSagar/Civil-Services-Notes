## Types of Rebellions [^2]

- popular resistance took three broad forms: civil rebellions, tribal uprisings and peasant movements

### Background

- Colonial economic policies, New land revenue system, colonial administration, judicial system and ruin of handicraft had impoverished the peasant
- One form that was taken to was to resort to petty crimes like robbery, dacoity etc

### Civil Rebellion

- Led by deposed Rajas their descendents, landlords, zamindars, poligars etc
- Peasants, artisans and demobilised soldiers were their support and man at arms
- **Reasons were local grievances** introduced through rapid change in economy, administration and land revenue system
- Landowners lost control of their land, peasants and artisans were indebted and forced into selling their property
- This was exacerbated by the rapid corruption in admin., police, judiciary etc
- religious preachers, priests, pandits and maulvis and men of arts and literature incited hatred against the foreign rulers

#### Limitation of These Rebellions

- were wholly local in their spread and isolated from each other
- They were result of local grievances which were common to almost all the rebellions
- **Leaders were backward looking** and traditional They did **not represent a societal alternative** and was old in ideological and cultural form

#### Characteristics of These Revolts

- Solidarity b/w tribals was unwavering they did not attack each other
- Non-tribal poor who worked in supporting role were not attacked. They were seen as allies.
