>   **KS Singh** has shown that the movt was related to Christianity. Mundas had accepted Christianity because they sympathised with them against the Zamindars. Zamindars attacked the German mission in Ranchi against this.

- But the Mundas soon turned against the missionaries after a new kingdom under John the Baptist was set up at Doesa.
- Birsa claimed medicinal and healing powers.
- followers wanted to establish a just order free from exploiters.
- active participation from women and lacked animosity against economically subordinate non-tribal people.

- Bullet to water, took to pilgrimage Munda holy places.
- & Disum - Munda land.
- Aim - destroy enemies, end B rule.
- Greater awareness of wider political realities.
- @ British rule replaced the Khuntkatti agrarian system, missionary activities insulted religiou and cultural ethos of Adivasis.
- Birsa was inspired by the **Sardari Larai Movt** that demanded restoration of tribal rights and relied on non violent means of sending prayers and petitions. Movt failed and Birsa realised it was futile sending petitions.
- & **Veth Begari** or feudal labour was also abused by the Britishers and the Dikus.
