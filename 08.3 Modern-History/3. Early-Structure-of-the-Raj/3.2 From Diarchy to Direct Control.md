## Need for Direct Control

- Single centre of power for far flung IN
- Corruption, bribery reason for parliamentary intervention
- Application of loan -> suspicion of mismanagement of resources
- Clive, Hastings, Wellesley tried un-sucessfully
- Adam Smith laissez fair was against monopoly which influenced decision of law makers

## Warren Hastings 1772 - 1785

### Administrative Reforms

- He had to give a workable system of adm to Bengal and transform EIC merchants into administrators.
- After removing the [[2.1 Bengal - Mir Jafar and Mir Kasim#Settlement of Bengal Dual System |Dual System]] and dismissing Reza Khan and Shitab Roy the Governor and Co Directors started appointing Collectors to manage rev affairs.
- He dec allowance of Nawab and redefined relations w/ Emepror Shah Aam -> took away Allahbad and Kara assigned to him.

### Revenue Reforms

- Resorted to system of trial and error/ experimentation to evolve a system of rev adm.
- Made 5 yr settlement by farming out estates to highest bidder on assumption that Zamindars were mere tax gatherers w/ no proprietary rights -> miserable failure since bidders had no interest in land.
- Indian Diwans under Provincial councils set up to supervise them -> replaced corrupt European collectors. Overall incharge was under Revenue Committee, Calcutta.
- Other problems were of subinfeudation of revenue farming, proxies used by officers of EIC.
- reverted in 1776 to old system of annual settlement where Zamindars were preferred. In 1781 Provincial councils were abolished, Collectors reappointed w/o power to settle rev.

 > - Hastings left behind him a dark trail of misery, insurrection and famines.
> - Cornwallis in 1789 said that 1/3rd of EIC territory in Hindustan is now jungel inhabited by only wild beasts

**Phillip Francis** : flourishing and rich India was reduced to beggary and ruin.  

**Percival Spear** : his achievements is an established fact and his character remains something of an enigma.
