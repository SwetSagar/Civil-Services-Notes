- Inc salaries of officials ex Collector to get Rs1500/month and 1% of total rev collected.
- Had low opinion of Indian character, ability and integrity. Sought higher offices be reserved for EU.
- Covenanted services were closed to Indian. In army they could not rise above Subedars and in civil service above Munsiffs, Sadr Amins or Deputy Collectors.

### Estimate of Cornwallis

- Lucky to have assistants like John Shore, James Grant, George Barlow etc.
- wanted anglicisaiton of Indians to solve its problems but his Europeanisation of covenanted services denied IN people their share.

```ad-Views

**Aspinal** :  possessed many qualities of mind and hear which inspired confidence in others. 

**Gleig** : wanted to make everything as English as possible in country that resembles England in nothing.

**WS Seton Karr** : He may not be on the same platform as Wellesley or Dalhousie but in constructive ability and in tenacity of purpose he may challenge with some of the most eminent men who ahve rule India.

**LM Penson** : Was upright and honest and did not fear sudden decline in favour. C was public servant who upheld national and not private traditions.
