- Special session at Calcutta Sept 1920 - NCN was *approved*

## December 1920 At the Nagpur Session

- non-cooperation was endorsed
- Congress decided to have the **attainment of swaraj** through peaceful and legitimate means as it primary goal
- CWC of 15 mem set up, provincial committees on linguistic basis was organised, ward committees was made and entry fee was reduced
- Gandhi said swaraj can be ushered in 1 year if non-cooperation program was implemented.
- Gandhiji suggested the NCN to the Khilafat committee on 9 June 1920.
- social distress over economic condition, higher prices, shortage of food, draughts and epidemics
- launched in August 1920
- Program included surrender of titles and honours, boycott of gov affiliated schools and colleges, law courts, foreign cloth and resignation from gov service as well as non-payment of taxes
- extra constitutional mass action, **revolutionary terrorists** also supported the movt
- Educational boycott was very successful in Bengal. Lawyers gave up their practice viz CR Das, Motilal Nehru, Kitchlew, Patel etc
- Boycott of foreign clothes, picketing of toddy and foreign cloth shops
- NCN slowly started to turn violent first during the visit of Prince of Wales in Bombay and later in Chauri Chaura
- The **Gandhi Reading talk** was held to diffuse tensions. Held in May 1921 before the Chauri Chaura. #important
- Gandhiji announced that mass civil disobedience shall be held from Bardoli was withdrawn on 12 Feb 1922 -> Chauri Chaura Happened.
- withdrawal is seen as a consequence to the radicalisation of the masses. Some say that it was to protect the propertied class.
- was done to curb repression which would have been intense after the Chauri Chaura incident.

## Analysis from Sekhar Bandyopadhyay

- Provided for surrender titles, boycott schools, courts, councils, boycott foreign goods, encourage national schools, arbitration courts and khadi
- Opposition from CR Das(later endorsed), Jinnah, Pal
- Also radical restructuring of INC - make it true mass org
- **Judith B** : Nagpur session was victory of MG
- **Rajat Ray + Richard Gordon** : MG capitulated to CR Das
- Support form M Khilafatists, backward classes
- Trade unionism, labour unrest
- Began 1921 emphasis middle class participation
- **Tilak Swaraj Fund**
- 1st violence in Bombay thus full scale CDM postponed
- Experimental no rev campaign at Bardoli in Guj
- Except Madras council election boycotted elsewhere.
- Economic boycott successful
- Middle class part not spectacular
- Marwari, Gujarati remained Pro Nationalist, large industrialist pro-gov
- Uneven geo spread and wide regional variation
    - Peasant part in Rajasthan, Sindh, Gujarat, Awadh, Assam, Maha, Ktaka unaffected
    - Lower caste part in Madras, Maha
    - Tribal in Andhra, Bengal, Assam
- Madras Justice party launched non Brahman movt against Brahman dominated INC.
	- It was formed in 1916 by TN Nair, P Tyagaraja, CN Mudaliar. Its initial demands were for reserved seats in Provincial Legislative Council that slowly extended to reservation in education, public appointments and nomination to local bodies.
- National schools, arb courts and Khadi (expensive) did not succeed everywhere.
- Akali Movt, Singh Sabha movt, SGPC, Jathas.
- Most effect in UP -> Baba Ramchandra, UP Kisan Sabha
- North Bihar -> Swami Viswananada, Kisan Sabha
- Midnapur Bengal -> Mahisya peasants leader BN Sasmal
- Patidar in Gujarat
- Cross caste mobil Awadh, militant
- Hill areas of Kumaun, Garhwal
    - **Richard Tucker** : political conflict reaching hills for 1st time. Incendiarism shows that it had little connection w/ formal Cong movt
- New meaning which depended on specific structure of society
