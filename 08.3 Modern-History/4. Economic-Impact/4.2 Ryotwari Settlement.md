## Overview

- Introduced in parts of Madras and Bombay presidency by Thomas Munro.
- Cultivator was to be recognised as owner of land
- The rights to Mirasdars or mem of village community and the peasants who directly paid taxes to state.
- Mirasdars became small landowners
- directly settled with ryot,
- avg income from different types of soils was estimated,
- a proportion of it fixed as the share of state, land resurveyed every 30 yr.
- Covered 52 % of cult land.

## Problems

- Exorbitant land revenue
- Govt right to enhance revenue at will
- Payment by ryots even when produce was partially/wholly destroyed
- poor soil, fluctuating rainfall,
- severity of collection,
- famine in 1832-34,
- mounting debts from loans

## Analysis and Historians Views [^1]

- Sindh, Assam, Coorg
- Absence of Z class in Madras -> RS
- Intro 1801 - 1807
- ==Local poligars recog as Z==
- Villages aggregated sold in auction to highest bidder
- **Scottish Enlightenment** : primacy of agri, importance of Yeoman farmers
- **Utilitarian ideas** influenced Munro, **Elphinstone** took initiative
- **Ricardo's theory of rent** : state had legitimate share to surplus from land
- ==1st started by Alexander Reed in Baramahal in 1792==
- Revenue directly from village
- Asses each ciltivator/ryots separately

> **Ludden** : State was supreme landlord peasants were landowners who obtained title by paying annual cash rent

- Rent to be premanently assesed through general survey of all lands
- Required detailed land survey - not done in practice
- ==Abandoned in 1807 reinstated in 1820 Munro== back argued Ryotwari was ancient IN
- Rev fixed on entire farm not field
- Privileges of Mirasidars, Brahmanas was respected
- Revenue officials combined police duties -> inc bribery, coercion, corruption as shown in **Madras Torture Commission Report 1855**
- After 1855 scientific fresh survey undertaken, rate 1/2 net value of produce made for 30 yrs intro 1864

### Impact

- Luddens study of Tirunelveli : mirasidars ==manipulated sys to convert collective right to individual property==
- Willem van Schendel study Kaveri delta Thanjavur : showed a polarised society, golden age for mirasidars
- **A Satyanarayan** : rise of peasant-bourgeoisie
- Brought in Bombay by Elphinstone in 1818
- Rates high -> frequent crop failure -> increased prices
- ==Bombay Survey Sys to fix land rates lowered demand to reasonable limit==

#### Impact in Rural Society

- Rural uprising 1875
- Neil Charlesworth :
 	- Bombay survey sys did not cause any dramatic change in west IN,
 	- village patil - ordinary peasant this process was already started,
 	- rights of Bhagadars, narudars were respected in Guj,
 	- political vacuum only in central deccan filled by Marwari, Gujarati banias
- **H Fukazawa** : no evidence land being bought by money lenders
- **Catanach** : dispossession did occur but did not cause uprising
- **Ravinder Kumar, Sumit Guha** : social upheaval/ status rev caused riots
- Social effects were less dramatic vis a vis PS
