- 29% of cultivable land under it
- Modified form of Zamindari introduced in ==Gangetic plains, North West Provinces, Central India and Punjab==.
- & Settlement was made to be **village by village with landlords or heads of the family**.
- **Metcalfe** + **Maine** early proponents
- Taluqdars per Nurul Hasan were 'intermediary Zamindars'
- Primary Zamindars had proprietary + habitational rights, included small owner cultivators
- Initially collected from local lineage dominated ruler and Mughal Jagirdars
- High rents resisted, earlier taluqdars liquidated -> new social class banker, moneylenders etc bcame new land owning class/ non cultivating
- Shift taluqdar -> Primary Zamindars
- Why was it brought ?
	- Check oppressive nature of taluq, protect peasant rights, improve agri, get high rev
- Problems :
	- Survey too complicated, over assessment, agri depression 1828, arrears, diff find buyers
- Regulation XI 1833 - RM bird
	- Assess rev of entire mahal/ fiscal unit base on net value of potential produce, state share 2/3 for 30 yr
	- Flattened whole surface of society many taluq were removed
