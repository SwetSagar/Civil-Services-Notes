![[Drawing 2022-09-10 10.17.16 Permanent Settlement.excalidraw |700]]

- Introduced in 1793 ==for Bengal, Bihar and Orissa==.
- @ Zamindar's became the owner of entire land in their Zamindaries and became agents of govt for collection of revenue
- they got 10% remuneration in the collection of revenue
- Land revenue to be collected was permanently fixed
- was ==extended to parts of Banaras and North Madras==.
- Zamindars were aka Rajas.
- was made with Zamindars/Rajas and Talukdars of Bengal traditionally they were not landowners but revenue collectors.
- ==Ryots were peasants==, in Bengal they mostly leased it out to under ryots.
- Rich ryots were called **Jotedars** and **Mandals**
- ~ **Amlah** were officers of the Zamindars who collected rent
- ~ **Adhiyars** and **Bargadars** were sharecroppers
- Covered 19 % total culti land
- Also in North Madras

## Why Permanent Settlement?

- hoped to resolve famines, inc agri output of rural Bengal.
- to assure a regular flow of income to Coy.
- ensure profit to entrepreneurs who would help improve agri.

## Problems

### Problems for Peasants

- Gov lost contact with the Peasants
- No scientific bias on fixation of revenue made it ad hoc and often very high
- Zamindari and Peasant historical tie was annulled

### Problems for Zamindars

- Zamindaries were auctioned for non-payment
- Money lenders, speculators etc now became Zamindar who did not have any interest in development of Peasant

## Effects of Permanent Settlement

- Taxes rose from Rs 6 lakh in 1763 to Rs 28 lakh in 1790. Famines, Hunger, Barren land were common occurrence.
- initial revenue demands were very high in 1790s price of agri produce was already depressed
- & demand was invariable regardless of the harvest
- power of zamindar was initially limited to collect rent and manage zamindari
- ==Collector emerged as a rival authority to the Zamindar==, rich ryots deliberately delayed payment
- Prosecution of defaulters was a long drawn process
- fictitious sale of zamindari assets, deliberate delaying of payment of purchase exhausted the state
- ==Jotedars emerged as a powerful class especially in North Bengal==, they lived within villages aka **Haoladars** and **Gantidars**
- Later in the 19th century zamindars who survived consolidated their powers
- **5th report** submitted to British parliament in 1813 dealt with administration and other activities ex petitions of zamindars and ryots, reports of collectors etc.
- **Francis Buchanans** exploits are important source for this period

## PS not Extended over other Regions because :

- fixed settlement, no claim over enhanced income
- **Ricardian theory** that was popular during the time - landowner should have claim only on the average rent - above which was to be taxed by state

## Analysis and Historians Views [^1]

- Existing sys impoverished country, ruined agri, dec in prod of silk or cotton
- Alexander Dow, Henri Parullo, Philip Francis and Thomas Law favored PS before Cornwalis
- Would reduce corruption, landlords would invest money on imp land, coy would get tax regularly

```ad-Views
collapse: open
- **PJ Marshall** : rev was 20% higher
- **BB Chaudhary** : rev doubled b/w 1765 - 1793
```

- Coy retained some zamindars replaced others, old customary rates were ignored
- Ease of collection to ensure loyalty
- Zamindar could sell mortgage and transfer it
- PS vested land ownership to Z previously only revenue rights
- Issues with PS
	- Written agreement rarely followed
	- Regulation of 1799 1812 gave Z right to seize property
	- Sunset clause
	- Frequent sale of Z estates 1804-1818
	- Subinfeudation by old Z
	- Legal reforms further strengthened rich peasants viz Jotedars

```ad-Views
-   **Rajat and Ratnalekha Ray** : revenue collecting right of Z remained unaffected aka Jotedar thesis  
- **Sugata Bose** :
  - Jotedar thesis of Rajat and Ratnalekha Ray has been countered 
  - says that it was confined only to Northern Bengal, 
  - 2 other modes viz peasant landholding-demesne in west and peasant small landholding in East 
  - supported by **Akinobu Kawai and Partha Chatterjee**
- **Nariaki Nakazato** : exitence of jotedar haoladar class in central and east Bengal
- **China Panda** - unqualified decline of Z
```
