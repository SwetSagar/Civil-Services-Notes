## Impact of Revenue Reforms on Rural Society

- Different social classes emerged during this time

### Thorner and Dhanagare's Model

- Daniel Thorner, DN Dhanagare model
- **1st group** landlords holding proprietary rights over large estates, absentee rentier class, no interest in land mgt or agri improvement
- **2nd group** Rich peasants i.e.
    - **Rich landowners** : proprietary rights, interest in culti but not participated
    - **Rich tenants** : substantial landholdings, security of occupany rights, paid nominal rents to landlords
- **3rd Group** : Middle Peasants
    - **Landowners** : medium size holdings or self-sufficient peasants, cultivated w/ family.
    - Tenants w/ substantial landholdings payed higher rents
- **4th Group** : poor peasants, tenants w/ no security, sharecroppers, tenants at will
- **5th Group** : Landless labourers

### Other Characterstics

- Pyramidal agrarian society
- 65 -70% non-owners of land
