## 1.1 Introduction

- destruction of traditional Indian industries was earliest consequence of colonialism.
- British gradually removed all of their competitors French, Dutch which put the artisans in a bad bargaining position with only one entity to sell to.
- Monopoly in the market, exploited the artisans to sell at a lower price so that their profit margins would be high
- This left them with little money to invest in newer technology

## 1.2 Effects of British Industrialisation on Indian Industry [^1]

- Industrial revolution in Europe wiped out the market for Indian artisans due to mass production of goods.
- also led the home market be invaded by cheap mass produced goods.
- In Gangetic Bihar ratio of industrial population to total pop dec from 18.6 in 1809 to 8.5% in 1901
- Industrial pop dec from 62.3% to 15.1 %
- Real income per worker in industry inc b/w 1900 - 1947

**Tirthankar Roy** on real income increase 
- achieved due to tech specialisation and industrial reorganisation like substitution of family labour w/ wage labour, 
- inc commercialisation and inc labour productivity in 

- Agri 80%, Mfd 10% and services 10-15%
- Discriminatory intervention
- IN money market was dominated by EU banking house
- Investment only in railway, jute, tea plantation and mining
- Chamber of commerce, Managing agency houses influenced gov policy - control 75% industrial capital

-   **RC Dutt and MM Malviya** showed that there was a significant increase in the value of Manchester cloth from 1860-1900.
-   Recent economic historians like **Sarda Raju for Madras, NK Sinha for Bengal, Bagchi for Bihar** have given considerable evidence of de-industrialisation
-   **Deniel Thorner** has tried to show that there was **no de-industrialisation** from 1881-1931.  A/C to him male work force increased and different industries should be lumped together so that now the decline does not look very high.

### 1.2.1 Criticism of No Deindustrialisation Theory :

> - damage had already been done before the census
> - completely dismissed the workforce of women as being erroneous which is not true as women are significant contributors to Indian agriculture
> - Certain imperialist openly admitted the need and desire for de-industrialisation of India viz John Maynard Keynes who wanted India to become prosperous by supplying agricultural good to the industrialised west
