The linguistic reorganisation of States (1935-1947); Regionalism and
regional inequality

1. "The reorganization resulted in rationalizing the political map of India without seriously
weakening its unity. If anything, its result has been functional, in as much as it removed what had been a major source of discord, and created homogeneous political units which could be administered through a medium that vast majority of the population understood. Indeed, it can be said with the benefit of hindsight that language, rather than being a force for division has proved a cementing and integrating influence." Examine. [2013, 25m]

2. "States's reorganization did not, of course, resolve all the problems relating to linguistic
conflicts." Critically examine. [2018, 10 Marks]
