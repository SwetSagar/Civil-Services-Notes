Emergence of Third World and non-alignment

1. Explain the circumstances leading to the emergence of Third World and analyze its impact on world affairs. [2010, 30 Marks]

```ad-Answer


The term “Third World” emerged in the 1950s to describe the countries that were not aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union during the Cold War. These countries, mostly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, were seen as economically and politically underdeveloped compared to the two superpowers. The Third World was characterized by poverty, inequality, and authoritarian governments.

The emergence of the Third World had a major impact on world affairs. It created a new dynamic in international politics, with the Third World countries challenging the dominance of the two superpowers. This led to the emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement, which sought to create an alternative platform for developing countries to pursue their own interests.

The Third World also played an important role in the decolonization process, with many countries gaining independence from their former colonial rulers in the 1950s and 1960s. This further shifted the balance of power in the world and led to the emergence of new regional powers.

Finally, the Third World was a major factor in the rise of the Global South and the emergence of new international organizations such as the United Nations. These organizations sought to promote economic development and social justice in the Third World countries, as well as to foster global cooperation.

The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) has played a role in promoting peace through various initiatives and statements throughout its history. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of NAM in promoting peace can be debated, as many of its members have had different interests and competing ideologies, which sometimes have made it difficult for the organization to achieve its objectives. Here are a few examples of instances where the NAM has played a role in promoting peace:

1.  The NAM has called for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations. For example, at the 14th Non-Aligned Summit in Cuba in 2006, member states reaffirmed the importance of peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of all countries.
    
2.  NAM has also emphasized the importance of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. For example, at the 16th Summit in Iran in 2012, the NAM member states reaffirmed the need for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and called for a nuclear-weapon-free world.
    
3.  The NAM has also played a role in promoting peace through its participation in various peacekeeping operations. For example, NAM member countries have contributed troops to peacekeeping missions in various conflict zones around the world such as the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) which was established in 1978 to maintain peace and security in the area.
    
4.  The NAM has also supported efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. For example, at the 16th Summit in Iran in 2012, NAM member states reaffirmed their support for the rights of the Palestinian people and called for an immediate end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.
    
5.  NAM has also played a role in promoting peace in the Korean Peninsula. For example, at the 17th Summit in Venezuela in 2016, NAM member states expressed their support for the peaceful resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue and called for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
    
6.  NAM has played a role in promoting peace in the Balkans. For example, at the 13th Summit in Indonesia in 1992, NAM member states expressed their support for the peaceful resolution of the Yugoslav crisis and called for the respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries in the region.
    
7.  NAM has played a role in promoting peace in Africa, for example, NAM has played a role in promoting peace in Africa. For example, at the 14th Summit in Cuba in 2006, NAM member states reaffirmed their commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa and called for the support for the efforts of the African Union and the United Nations in maintaining peace and security on the continent.

8.  NAM has played a role in promoting peace in South Asia. For example, at the 16th Summit in Iran in 2012, NAM member states expressed their support for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue and called for the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries in the region.
    
9.  NAM has played a role in promoting peace in Syria. For example, at the 17th Summit in Venezuela in 2016, NAM member states expressed their support for the peaceful resolution of the Syrian crisis and called for the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria.
    
10.  NAM has played a role in promoting peace in Iran-Iraq War. For example, at the 4th Summit in New Delhi in 1983, NAM member states expressed their support for the peaceful resolution of the Iran-Iraq War and called for the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries.

**Instances where NAM failed to promote peace**

1.  The NAM's stance towards the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975, was considered to be ambiguous and inconsistent. Many NAM member states, including India, Egypt, and Yugoslavia, supported the United States and the South Vietnamese government, while other NAM member states, such as Indonesia and Cuba, supported the North Vietnamese government and the communist National Liberation Front.
    
2.  The NAM's position on the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted from 1980 to 1988, was also considered to be ambiguous and inconsistent. Many NAM member states, including Egypt, Yugoslavia, and India, supported Iraq, while other NAM member states, such as Cuba and Tanzania, supported Iran.
    
3.  The NAM's stance towards the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 was also criticized as being inconsistent. While some member states, such as India, condemned the invasion, other member states, such as Cuba, supported it.
    
4.  The NAM's position on the civil war in Angola, which lasted from 1975 to 2002, was also considered to be ambiguous and inconsistent. Many NAM member states, such as Cuba, supported the ruling MPLA government, while other NAM member states, such as Yugoslavia, supported the opposition UNITA movement.
    
5.  The NAM's stance towards the Yugoslav Wars, which lasted from 1991 to 2001, was also considered to be ambiguous and inconsistent. Some member states, such as India, supported the independence of Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, while other member states, such as Yugoslavia, supported the preservation of Yugoslavia.

The above examples demonstrate the effectiveness of NAM as well as some of its failures.

According to Gaddis, NAM had an ambiguous and inconsistent stance towards the Cold War and its members had different interests and competing ideologies, which sometimes have made it difficult for the organization to achieve its objectives.

Gaddis has argued that the NAM's effectiveness in promoting peace and security was limited by its lack of a clear strategy or agenda. He has also noted that the organization was not a military alliance, and it didn't have the power to enforce peace or impose sanctions on countries that violate its principles. He also highlighted that the NAM's effectiveness in promoting peace and security was limited by the fact that many of its members were not truly "non-aligned" and had close ties with one of the two superpowers.
