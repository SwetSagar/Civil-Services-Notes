Emergence of two power blocs

1. In the post -Second World War scenario friends in war did not remain friends in peace. Examine the truth of this view in the period of your study. [1999, 60 Marks]

```ad-Answer

The statement "friends in war did not remain friends in peace" holds true in the post-Second World War scenario. One of the most significant examples of this phenomenon is the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. The two nations were allies during the war, working together to defeat Nazi Germany, but their relationship quickly soured in the post-war period as they emerged as the two dominant world powers.

1. The United States and Soviet Union had fundamentally different ideologies, with the U.S. promoting democracy and capitalism and the Soviet Union promoting communism. These differences led to a period of intense tension and competition between the two nations known as the Cold War. The U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in a global competition for influence, which was characterized by proxy wars, arms races, and political maneuvering.

	One key event that marked the beginning of the Cold War was the Yalta Conference in February 1945, where the leaders of the U.S., Soviet Union, and Great Britain met to discuss the post-war reorganization of Europe. At the conference, the U.S. and Soviet Union were unable to reach agreement on several key issues, including the future of Eastern Europe.

2. Another example of this phenomenon is the relationship between the Soviet Union and its former allies, Eastern European countries. During the war, the Soviet Union had liberated Eastern Europe from Nazi control, but in the post-war period, the Soviet Union imposed communist governments on these countries and imposed Soviet control over them.

	Eastern European countries were liberated by Soviet Union during the war, but in the post-war period, the Soviet Union imposed communist governments on these countries and imposed Soviet control over them. One key event that marked the beginning of Soviet control over Eastern Europe was the establishment of the Warsaw Pact in 1955, a military alliance between Soviet-controlled Eastern European countries.

3. The Chinese and Soviet Union also had a similar situation, China and Soviet Union fought together during the war but post-war, the two nations had a falling out due to ideological differences and border disputes.

	One key event that marked the beginning of the Sino-Soviet split was the Sino-Soviet Border Conflict in 1969, where the two nations fought a series of border clashes along the Ussuri River.

4.  UK and US: While the UK and the US were allies during the war, there were several instances where they did not cooperate in the post-war period. One key event that marked the beginning of the tension between these two nations was the Suez Crisis in 1956, where the UK, France, and Israel invaded Egypt, which was condemned by the United States. The US President Eisenhower pressurized the UK to withdraw its troops from Egypt, which forced the UK to withdraw its troops and this marked a turning point in their relationship.

	Another example of lack of cooperation between the UK and US was the UK's application to join the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1961, which was met with opposition from the US. The US saw the EEC as a potential rival to NATO and as a threat to its economic interests in Europe.

	Additionally, during the Cold War, the UK and US had different views on how to deal with the Soviet Union, which led to disagreements on various issues including the arms control, decolonization and the role of UN.

- Stalin rule from 1941 to 1953

```ad-Answer

The view that Stalinist Russia was a despotic regime is a widely held belief among historians, political scientists, and other experts. Stalin's rule, which lasted from the late 1920s until his death in 1953, was characterized by authoritarian control, repression, and a cult of personality.

One of the key features of Stalin's regime was the use of repression and terror to maintain control. Stalin's secret police, the NKVD, was responsible for widespread repression, including mass arrests, deportations, and executions of political opponents, perceived enemies of the state, and ethnic minorities. Millions of people were arrested and sent to forced labor camps, where many died from harsh conditions, starvation, and disease.

Stalin's regime was also marked by a cult of personality, with Stalin himself being idolized as a hero and leader. Stalin's image was everywhere, and the Soviet people were expected to worship him as a god-like figure. Stalin's cult of personality was used to justify his rule and to suppress dissent.

Another feature of Stalin's regime was the use of propaganda to control the population, Stalin's government controlled the media, and the information that was disseminated to the public was heavily censored and controlled. The government also used propaganda to promote Stalin's cult of personality, as well as to justify its policies and repressions.

**Despotic Measures of Stalin**

1.  The Great Purge: One of the most notable examples of Stalin's repression was the Great Purge, which took place from 1936 to 1938. During this time, Stalin ordered the arrest, execution, or forced labor of millions of Soviet citizens, including many of his own political rivals and perceived enemies of the state. This period is characterized by mass repression, where NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) arrested, exiled and executed millions of people on the charges of being "enemies of the people", "counter-revolutionaries", "saboteurs" etc.
    
2.  Forced collectivization: Stalin implemented a policy of forced collectivization, which aimed to create large collective farms and eliminate the private ownership of land. This policy led to the forced relocation of millions of people, as well as the confiscation of private property, and the deaths of millions of people due to starvation and disease.
    
3.  Show Trials: Stalin's regime also conducted show trials, where prominent political figures were publicly tried and convicted on false charges of treason and other crimes. These show trials were widely publicized and served as a means of intimidating political opponents and consolidating Stalin's power.
	- The Moscow Trials: In the late 1930s, Stalin ordered a series of show trials, known as the Moscow Trials, in which prominent members of the Communist Party were falsely accused of treason and other crimes. These trials were widely publicized and served as a means of intimidating political opponents and consolidating Stalin's power.
	
4.  The Gulag system: Stalin's regime also created a vast system of forced labor camps, known as the Gulag, where millions of people were sent as punishment for perceived political crimes. These camps were characterized by harsh conditions, forced labor, and high death rates.
    
5.  The cult of personality: Stalin's personality cult was a significant feature of Stalin's rule. Stalin's image was everywhere, and the Soviet people were expected to worship him as a god-like figure. Stalin's cult of personality was used to justify his rule and to suppress dissent.
6. The deportations of ethnic minorities: Stalin's regime also targeted ethnic minorities, such as the Crimean Tatars, Chechens, and Koreans, for deportation. In many cases, these deportations were carried out with little or no warning, and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people due to starvation and disease.
    
2.  The suppression of dissent: Stalin's regime was characterized by the suppression of dissent, including censorship of the media, repression of political opponents, and the use of propaganda to control the population. Stalin's government controlled the media and the information that was disseminated to the public was heavily censored and controlled.
    
3.  The repression of intellectuals and artists: Stalin's regime also targeted intellectuals and artists, many of whom were arrested and sent to labor camps, exiled or executed. The government also implemented strict controls on literature, art and music, only works that promote the Soviet ideologies and Stalin's cult of personality were allowed to be published or performed.
    
4.  The repression of religion: Stalin's regime also targeted religion, many religious leaders were arrested, exiled or executed and religious institutions were suppressed. The government also implemented strict controls on religious practices, only state-approved religious practices were allowed.

1. "After World War II, the strategy of the West towards Soviet bloc crystallized as a 'policy of containment'." Comment. [2008, 20 Marks]

```ad-Answer

The "policy of containment" was a strategy developed by the United States and its Western allies after World War II to prevent the spread of Soviet communism and the expansion of Soviet influence around the world. The main idea behind the policy of containment was to limit Soviet expansion and to "contain" the Soviet Union within its existing borders.

The policy of containment was first articulated by American diplomat George F. Kennan in a famous article in Foreign Affairs in 1947, in which he argued that the Soviet Union was an inherently expansionist power that could only be stopped by a strong and consistent policy of containment. Kennan's article laid the foundation for the US policy of containment, which was later implemented by President Harry Truman.

The policy of containment was based on a number of different tactics, including diplomatic, economic, and military measures. Diplomatic measures included efforts to build alliances with other countries to counter Soviet influence, while economic measures included the use of the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe and promote capitalist economies. Military measures included the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 to provide a military alliance against the Soviet Union.

**Actions taken by West to contain the USSR**

1.  The Truman Doctrine (1947): President Harry Truman announced the Truman Doctrine, which provided military and economic assistance to countries threatened by Soviet expansion. This was the first official statement of the policy of containment.
    
2.  The Formation of NATO (1949): The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed in 1949, which was a military alliance of Western nations to counter Soviet expansion.
    
3.  The U-2 Incident (1960): The United States conducted U-2 spy plane flights over the Soviet Union to gather intelligence on Soviet military capabilities and to contain Soviet expansion.
    
4.  The Berlin Wall (1961): The Soviet Union erected the Berlin Wall to contain the movement of people between East and West Berlin, in order to prevent the spread of Western ideas and influence in East Germany.
    
5.  The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962): The United States and Soviet Union came close to nuclear war over the Soviet Union's installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The United States took a number of actions, including a naval blockade of Cuba, to force the Soviet Union to remove the missiles, which was an effort to contain Soviet expansion in the Western Hemisphere.
    
6.  The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty: The United States and Soviet Union engaged in negotiations to limit the number of nuclear weapons, which was an effort to contain the arms race and potential nuclear war between the two nations.

```ad-Answer

The Suez Crisis was a political and military conflict that took place in 1956, and it was one of the major events of the Cold War. The crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including the growing tensions between the Western powers and Egypt over the control of the Suez Canal, and the growing tensions between Egypt and Israel over the status of the Gaza Strip. Here is a chronological overview of the circumstances leading up to the Suez Crisis:

1.  Nationalization of the Suez Canal (1956): On July 26, 1956, the Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal. The canal, which was owned and operated by the Suez Canal Company, was a vital waterway that connected the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea and was considered a strategic asset by the Western powers.
    
2.  The Reaction of the Western Powers: The Western powers, particularly France and the United Kingdom, were deeply concerned about the nationalization of the canal and saw it as a threat to their economic and strategic interests. They believed that the nationalization would give Egypt control over the passage of ships through the canal and would allow Egypt to use the canal as a weapon against the West.
    
3.  The Tripartite Declaration (1956): In response to the nationalization of the Suez Canal, the United Kingdom, France, and Israel signed the Tripartite Declaration, which pledged to take action to protect their interests in the Middle East.
    
4.  The Invasion of Egypt (1956): On October 29, 1956, Israel, with the support of the United Kingdom and France, launched an invasion of Egypt. The invasion was justified on the grounds that Egypt had been supporting Palestinian militants who were attacking Israel and that the Suez Canal was under threat.
	- The involvement of British and French soldiers in the invasion of Egypt in 1956 was a result of a secret agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and Israel known as the "Protocol of Sèvres." The agreement was made in the aftermath of the nationalization of the Suez Canal by Egypt, and it was intended to provide a pretext for the invasion of Egypt.

	- The agreement, which was signed on October 24, 1956, stated that Israel would launch an invasion of Egypt, and that the United Kingdom and France would then intervene, claiming that they were acting to separate the Israeli and Egyptian forces and protect the Suez Canal. This would give the appearance that the British and French were not involved in the invasion and that it was done to separate the Israeli and Egyptian forces.

	- In reality, the British and French had been planning the invasion for months, and they had been providing Israel with intelligence and logistical support. The Protocol of Sèvres was an effort to provide a pretext for the invasion, and it was intended to give the appearance that the British and French were not involved in the invasion and that it was done to separate the Israeli and Egyptian forces.

	- The invasion began on October 29, 1956, and it was a success for Israel. However, the British and French intervention did not go as planned. The United States, Soviet Union, and the United Nations all condemned the invasion, and there was an international outrage. The United Nations passed a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of the invading forces, and the United States and Soviet Union pressured the United Kingdom, France and Israel to withdraw their forces.
    
5.  The UN Condemnation of the Invasion (1956): On November 2, 1956, the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the invasion of Egypt and calling for an immediate withdrawal of the invading forces.
    
6.  The U.S. and Soviet Union's reaction: The United States and Soviet Union, who were the two major superpowers of the Cold War, both condemned the invasion and called for an immediate withdrawal of the invading forces. The United States, under President Eisenhower, pressured the United Kingdom, France, and Israel to withdraw their forces, while the Soviet Union used the crisis as an opportunity to increase its influence in the Middle East.

7.  The Withdrawal of the Invading Forces (1956-1957): Under pressure from the United Nations, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and Israel were forced to withdraw their forces from Egypt. The withdrawal was completed in March 1957, and the Suez Canal was returned to Egyptian control.

**Other factors that contributed to the suez crisis.** 

1.  The Cold War: The Suez Crisis was a major event of the Cold War, and the actions of the Western powers and the Soviet Union were shaped by the larger context of the Cold War. The Western powers saw the nationalization of the Suez Canal as a threat to their economic and strategic interests, while the Soviet Union saw an opportunity to increase its influence in the Middle East.
    
2.  Economic Interests: The Suez Canal was a vital waterway that connected the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea and was considered a strategic asset by the Western powers. The nationalization of the canal was seen as a threat to their economic interests, as it would give Egypt control over the passage of ships through the canal and would allow Egypt to use the canal as a weapon against the West.
    
3.  Nationalism and Decolonization: The Suez Crisis was also shaped by the growing nationalism sentiment in Egypt and the broader region, which was driven by the desire for independence and self-determination. The nationalization of the Suez Canal was seen as a symbol of Egyptian sovereignty and was popular among the Egyptian people.
    
4.  The Israel-Palestine Conflict: The Suez Crisis was also shaped by the growing tensions between Israel and Egypt over the status of the Gaza Strip. Israel was concerned about the support that Egypt was providing to Palestinian militants who were attacking Israel, and this was one of the reasons for its participation in the invasion of Egypt.
    
5.  Domestic politics: Domestic politics also played a role in the Suez Crisis. The French Prime Minister Guy Mollet and the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, were facing domestic challenges and the crisis provided them with an opportunity to gain some political leverage.
    
6.  Oil politics: Control over the Suez Canal and oil was also a major factor in the crisis. The Canal was a crucial route for oil transport, and the nationalization of the canal had an impact on oil transport and prices which the western nations found it unacceptable.

**Repercussion of the Suez crisis.**

The Suez Crisis had far-reaching consequences for the Middle East and the world. Some of the major repercussions of the crisis include:

1.  Damage to relations between the Western powers and Egypt: The Suez Crisis damaged the relations between the Western powers and Egypt. The invasion of Egypt by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel was widely condemned, and it led to a breakdown in trust between the Western powers and Egypt.
    
2.  Damage to the reputation of the United Kingdom and France: The Suez Crisis also damaged the reputation of the United Kingdom and France. The two countries were seen as aggressors and their actions were widely criticized. The crisis marked the end of the era of colonial power in the region and the emergence of newly independent countries as major players in the Middle East.
    
3.  The emergence of the United States as a mediator and peacekeeper: The Suez Crisis led to the United States becoming more involved in the Middle East as a mediator and peacekeeper. The United States played a key role in pressuring the United Kingdom, France, and Israel to withdraw their forces, and it was seen as a champion of the rights of newly independent countries.
    
4.  Increase of Soviet influence in the Middle East: The Suez Crisis also led to an increase in Soviet influence in the Middle East. The Soviet Union used the crisis as an opportunity to increase its influence in the region by providing military and economic aid to Egypt and other countries in the region.
    
5.  Economic Consequences: The Suez Crisis had significant economic consequences for the world economy. The crisis led to a sharp increase in oil prices, as oil was transported through the Suez Canal, and this led to an economic recession in many countries.
    
6.  Impact on United Nations: The Suez Crisis also had a significant impact on the United Nations. The United Nations passed a resolution condemning the invasion of Egypt and calling for an immediate withdrawal of the invading forces. The crisis was one of the first major tests of the United Nations' ability to resolve conflicts and it revealed some of the limitations of the organization.
    
7.  Impact on Israel: The Suez Crisis also had a significant impact on Israel. Israel's participation in the invasion of Egypt led to a deterioration of relations with many countries in the region, and it increased the isolation of Israel in the Middle East.
    
8.  Impact on the Israel-Palestine conflict: The Suez Crisis also had an impact on the Israel-Palestine conflict. The crisis led to the United States becoming more involved in the conflict as a mediator, and it also led to an increase in tensions between Israel and Egypt, which would continue to escalate in the years to come. Additionally, the crisis also led to a shift in the balance of power in the region, with newly independent countries becoming major players in the Middle East, and this had an impact on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

9.  Impact on the Cold War: The Suez Crisis also had an impact on the Cold War. The crisis led to a shift in the balance of power between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the United States becoming more involved in the Middle East as a mediator and peacekeeper. Additionally, the crisis also led to an increase in Soviet influence in the region, which would have implications for the Cold War.

The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan were major foreign policy initiatives of the United States in the post-World War II era. The Truman Doctrine, announced in 1947, was a policy of providing military and economic aid to countries threatened by communism. The Marshall Plan, announced in 1948, was a program of providing economic aid to European countries to rebuild their economies after World War II.

The Soviet Union and the countries of the Eastern bloc saw these initiatives as a weapon against Russia, aimed at restricting its influence in the world. They believed that the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan were designed to create a "cordon sanitaire" or a barrier around the Soviet Union, to contain its expansion and prevent the spread of communism.

Historians have different views on this. Some argue that the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan were indeed aimed at containing the Soviet Union and restricting its influence in the world. For example, John Lewis Gaddis in his book "The United States and the Origins of the Cold War, 1941-1947" writes: "The Truman Doctrine was the first step in a comprehensive strategy of containment that would come to define American foreign policy during the Cold War".

However, others argue that the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan were not specifically aimed at the Soviet Union, but rather were a response to the global challenges of the time. For example, Melvyn Leffler in his book "A Preponderance of Power: National Security, the Truman Administration, and the Cold War" writes: "The Marshall Plan was not a weapon against the Soviet Union; it was a response to the economic crisis in Europe".

Additionally, some historians argue that the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan were not solely driven by the fear of communism, but by the need to address the economic and security concerns in the post-war Europe, such as the fear of another war and to prevent the spread of poverty and instability.

In conclusion, the view that the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan were considered by Russian Bloc as a weapon against Russia in order to restrict her influence is a partially true. While it's true that the Soviet Union and the countries of the Eastern bloc saw these initiatives as a tool to contain their expansion and limit their influence, It's also important to take into account the other factors that motivated

Détente, which means "relaxation" or "easing of tensions," was a policy of reduced tensions and increased communication between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The circumstances leading to détente can be outlined as follows:

1.  The Nuclear Threat: Both the United States and the Soviet Union had developed nuclear weapons by the early 1960s, and the threat of nuclear war between the two superpowers became a major concern. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, in which the United States and the Soviet Union came close to nuclear war, served as a wake-up call for both sides.
    
2.  Economic Factors: Both the United States and the Soviet Union were facing economic challenges in the 1970s. The United States was facing stagflation, which is a combination of high inflation and high unemployment, while the Soviet Union was facing economic stagnation. Both sides saw détente as a way to ease economic tensions.
    
3.  Political Factors: The United States and the Soviet Union both had new leaders in the early 1970s. Richard Nixon became president of the United States in 1969, and Leonid Brezhnev became leader of the Soviet Union in 1964. Both leaders were looking for ways to ease tensions between their countries.
    
4.  Tiredness of Cold War: Both the United States and the Soviet Union were tired of the constant tensions and conflicts of the Cold War. Both sides were looking for ways to reduce tensions and improve communication.
    
5.  The Vietnam War: The Vietnam War also played a role in the development of détente. The United States and the Soviet Union were both involved in the war in different ways, and the war was a major drain on both countries' resources.

The policy was marked by a series of agreements and negotiations between the two superpowers, including the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), which helped to reduce the risk of nuclear war between the two sides

**Various events that caused detente were :**

1.  Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I): This was a series of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union that took place between 1969 and 1972. They resulted in the signing of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) in 1972, which limited the number of anti-missile defense systems that the two countries could deploy.
    
2.  The Moscow Summit: President Nixon visited Moscow in 1972 and met with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. The two leaders signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) and the Basic Principles of Relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which marked an important step towards détente.
    
3.  The Helsinki Accords: These were a series of agreements signed in 1975 between 35 countries, including the United States and the Soviet Union, that aimed to improve relations and reduce tensions between the East and the West. The accords dealt with issues such as human rights, security, and economic cooperation.
    
5.  The Camp David Accords: The Camp David Accords were a peace treaty signed between Israel and Egypt in 1978. The United States played a key role in the negotiations, and the treaty marked a major step towards détente in the Middle East.

The Marshall Plan, officially known as the European Recovery Program (ERP), was a foreign aid program announced by the United States Secretary of State George Marshall on June 5, 1947, during a speech at Harvard University. The circumstances leading to the adoption of the Marshall Plan were as follows:

1.  The devastation of World War II: Europe was left in a state of economic and social ruin after World War II, with cities and infrastructure destroyed, and millions of people displaced and suffering from food shortages and poverty. The US realized that the economic instability in Europe could lead to the rise of extremist movements and another war.
    
2.  The spread of communism: The Soviet Union was attempting to expand its influence in Europe and the US saw the economic instability as an opportunity for the spread of communism. They realized that economic recovery in Europe was essential for the security of the US and the Western world.
    
3.  The Truman Doctrine: The Truman Doctrine, announced in March 1947, was a policy of providing military and economic aid to countries threatened by communism. The Marshall Plan was seen as an extension of the Truman Doctrine, providing economic aid to Europe to prevent the spread of communism.
    
4.  The Monnet Plan: The Monnet Plan, named after French economist Jean Monnet, called for the reconstruction of Europe's economy through the establishment of a European coal and steel community. The US saw the Monnet Plan as a way to promote economic cooperation and integration in Europe, which would make it less susceptible to communist influence.
    
5.  The economic crisis in the US: The US was experiencing economic difficulties, high inflation, and unemployment, and the Marshall Plan was seen as a way to boost the US economy by increasing exports to Europe.

The Marshall Plan was considered a major success and is widely credited with helping to rebuild the European economy and prevent the spread of communism in Europe.
