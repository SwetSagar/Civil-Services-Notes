The United Nations (UN) has played a major role in peacekeeping efforts since its establishment in 1945. UN peacekeeping operations are intended to help countries transition from conflict to peace, such as by monitoring ceasefires, enforcing peace agreements, and providing security for civilians. According to former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, “The United Nations has become almost a synonym for peacekeeping.” 

UN peacekeeping operations have achieved some successes, such as in East Timor in 1999, where UN forces helped establish peace after years of civil war. However, the UN has also faced criticism for its peacekeeping efforts.

1. Success: In 1995, the UN peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina helped to end a three-year civil war, resulting in the Dayton Peace Accords. 

2. Success: The UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti helped to restore democracy in the country in 1994. 

3. Failure: The UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) has been criticized for its inability to prevent violence and protect civilians in the country. 

4. Failure: The UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has been criticized for its inability to protect civilians from violence and prevent the country from sliding into civil war. 

5. Success: The UN peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) helped to end a decade-long civil war in the country in 2002. 

6. Failure: The UN peacekeeping mission in Syria (UNSMIS) has been criticized for its inability to protect civilians from violence and prevent the conflict from escalating. For example, a 2017 report from the International Peace Institute found that UN peacekeeping operations often lack the resources and personnel needed to effectively implement their mandates.

The statement that the role of the United Nations Organization (UNO) as a peacekeeper and international mediator has been somewhat lackluster, muted, and continues to be so even after the end of the Cold War, suggests that the UN has not been as effective in fulfilling its mandate to maintain international peace and security as it should have been. Here are a few examples that validate this point:

1.  The UN's failure to intervene effectively in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, in which an estimated 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed by Hutu extremists, has been widely criticized. The UN peacekeeping mission in Rwanda at the time, UNAMIR, was under-staffed and under-equipped, and was unable to prevent the genocide from taking place.
    
2.  The UN's inability to prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, in which Bosnian Serb forces killed more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, has been widely criticized. UN peacekeepers were present in the area but were unable to prevent the massacre from taking place.
    
3.  The UN's failure to intervene effectively in the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, has been widely criticized. The UN has been unable to broker a ceasefire or bring an end to the conflict, which has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions.
    
4.  The UN's inability to prevent the ongoing conflict in Yemen, which began in 2015, has been widely criticized. The UN has been unable to broker a ceasefire or bring an end to the conflict, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people and the displacement of millions.
    
5.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, has been widely criticized. 
    
6.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Somalia, which began in 1991, has been widely criticized. Despite the presence of UN peacekeepers and multiple rounds of peace talks, the conflict continues with no end in sight.
    
7.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Sudan, which began in 1983, has been widely criticized. Despite the presence of UN peacekeepers and multiple rounds of peace talks, the conflict continues with no end in sight.
    
8.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which began in 1996, has been widely criticized. Despite the presence of UN peacekeepers and multiple rounds of peace talks, the conflict continues with no end in sight.
    
9.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Myanmar, which began in 1962, has been widely criticized. 

    
10.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Colombia, which began in 1964, has been widely criticized. 

11.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka, which began in 1983, has been widely criticized. 
    
12.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which began in 2014, has been widely criticized.
    
13.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Venezuela, which began in 2013, has been widely criticized. 
    
14.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Central African Republic, which began in 2012, has been widely criticized. 
    
15.  The UN's inability to prevent or resolve the ongoing conflict in Mali, which began in 2012, has been widely criticized.
