Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that existed in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. The word apartheid is an Afrikaans word that literally means “apartness.” It was a system of racial segregation enforced through legislation by the National Party governments, who were the ruling party from 1948 to 1994.

The struggle against apartheid was a long and difficult one, with many different groups and individuals contributing to the struggle. The African National Congress (ANC) was the most prominent organization leading the struggle against apartheid. Founded in 1912, the ANC was a political party that advocated for the rights of black South Africans. The ANC used a variety of tactics, including peaceful protests and civil disobedience, to fight for civil rights and equality for black South Africans.

The ANC was banned in 1960, but the struggle against apartheid continued. In the 1970s and 1980s, anti-apartheid organizations such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) emerged to continue the struggle. The UDF organized mass protests, strikes, and boycotts, while the SACP provided an ideological framework for the struggle.

In 1985, the South African government declared a state of emergency in response to the increasing unrest. This led to mass arrests and the banning of many anti-apartheid organizations. However, the struggle continued and in 1990, the government lifted the ban on the ANC and began negotiations with the organization.

In 1994, the first democratic elections were held in South Africa and the ANC was elected to power. Nelson Mandela, the leader of the ANC, was elected as the first President of a democratic South Africa.

“The struggle for freedom and democracy has been won. Our march to freedom is irreversible. We must not allow fear to stand in our way.” – Nelson Mandela, 1994 

In 1996, the South African government adopted a new constitution that abolished the system of apartheid and granted equal rights to all citizens.

Since then, South Africa has made great strides towards healing the wounds of apartheid and creating a more equitable society. While inequality and poverty still exist in South Africa, the country has made significant progress in improving the lives of its citizens.

1. Hermann Giliomee described apartheid as "a system of racial segregation that was enforced by a series of laws and regulations designed to restrict the rights of the majority of South Africans, and to keep the white minority in power" (Giliomee, 2003).

2. Stephen Ellis argued that apartheid was "a form of racial discrimination that was enforced by a series of laws and regulations designed to ensure the political, economic, and social domination of the white minority over the black majority" (Ellis, 1996).

1. "There must be an end to white monopoly on political power, and a fundamental restructuring of our political and economic systems to ensure that the inequalities of apartheid are addressed, and our society thoroughly democratized." Discuss. [2013, 25 Marks]

The end of white monopoly on political power is a key step towards the full democratization of South Africa. As Nelson Mandela said: “It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.” 

The legacy of apartheid is still evident in South Africa today and the country needs to take steps to address the structural inequalities that remain. This includes a fundamental restructuring of the political and economic systems, with a focus on creating opportunities for all South Africans regardless of race, gender, or class.

The government has taken some steps towards this goal, such as the National Development Plan, which aims to reduce poverty and inequality. However, more needs to be done to ensure that all South Africans have access to the same opportunities. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu said: “It is not enough to remove the structures of apartheid; we must build a new society, a society based on justice and equality for all.” 

The end of white monopoly on political power is an important step towards achieving this goal. It is essential that all South Africans have a say in the decisions that affect their lives and that the government works to ensure that everyone has equal access to resources and opportunities. Only then can we build a truly democratic South Africa.

1. Segregation: Apartheid was a system of racial segregation enforced by the South African government in 1948. This system divided people into four racial groups: White, Black, Indian, and Coloured. Each racial group was assigned to a specific area and prohibited from living in other areas.

2. Political Repression: Apartheid was a system of political repression that denied non-white South Africans the right to vote, hold public office, or participate in the political process. 

3. Pass Laws: Apartheid also included the infamous pass laws, which required non-white South Africans to carry identification documents at all times. These laws were used to restrict the movement of non-white people and limit their access to certain areas.

4. Forced Removals: The South African government also used forced removals to move non-white people out of certain areas and into segregated townships. This was done in order to make way for white development and to further isolate non-white people.

5. Denial of Rights: Apartheid denied non-white South Africans the right to own land, the right to an education, and the right to basic services such as healthcare.

6. Censorship: Apartheid also included censorship of the press and media. This was done in order to control what information was available to the public.

7. Bantustans: The South African government created Bantustans, or “homelands”, for black South Africans. These were areas of land where black people were expected to live and work.

8. Separate Amenities: Apartheid also included separate amenities for white and non-white people. This included separate beaches, parks, buses, schools, and other public facilities.

9. Group Areas Act: The Group Areas Act was a law that restricted where different racial groups could live. This act was used to further segregate non-white South Africans and limit their access to resources.

10. Grand Apartheid: Grand Apartheid was the final phase of Apartheid, which was implemented in the 1980s. This phase included the introduction of the “influx control” system, which was used to control the movement of non-white South Africans.
