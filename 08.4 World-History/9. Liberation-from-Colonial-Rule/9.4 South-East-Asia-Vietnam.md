## Major Events Leading Upto the Unification.

1. August Revolution of 1945: On August 19th, 1945, Ho Chi Minh and the Việt Minh independence movement launched a nationwide rebellion against French colonial rule. This marked the beginning of the August Revolution, which resulted in the formation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) with Ho Chi Minh as its President.
2. First Indochina War: The French, who had previously controlled Vietnam as a colony, refused to recognize the DRV and launched a military campaign to regain control of the country. This led to the First Indochina War, which lasted from 1946 to 1954. During this time, Ho Chi Minh and the Việt Minh led a guerrilla war against the French, which ultimately resulted in the French withdrawal from Vietnam in 1954.
3. Geneva Accords: On July 21st, 1954, the Geneva Accords were signed between the French, the DRV, and other parties, which officially ended the First Indochina War. The accords established a temporary demilitarized zone (DMZ) at the 17th parallel, dividing Vietnam into two separate countries, the North and the South.
4. Second Indochina War: Following the Geneva Accords, the United States began to provide military aid and support to the government of South Vietnam, led by Ngo Dinh Diem, in its fight against the communist-led North Vietnamese government. This led to the outbreak of the Second Indochina War, also known as the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975.
5. Tet Offensive: In 1968, the North Vietnamese and the Việt Cong launched a surprise attack on South Vietnamese cities during the Tet holiday, which came to be known as the Tet Offensive. This was a major turning point in the war, as it demonstrated the strength and determination of the North Vietnamese and the weakness of the South Vietnamese government and its U.S. allies.
6. Paris Peace Accords: In 1973, peace negotiations between the U.S., the North Vietnamese government, and the South Vietnamese government resulted in the signing of the Paris Peace Accords. The accords called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam and a ceasefire between the North and South.
7. Fall of Saigon: In 1975, the North Vietnamese launched a final offensive, which led to the fall of Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, on April 30th. This marked the end of the Second Indochina War and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.

**Nascent Nationalism**

Nascent Nationalism is a term used to describe the early stages of national identity formation in East Asian nations. It is a process of self-determination and collective identity building among the people of a nation that is characterized by a strong sense of pride and loyalty to the nation, its culture, and its people.

According to John Dower, a professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “Nascent Nationalism was a product of the nineteenth century, when East Asian nations were increasingly exposed to the ideas of the West and began to develop their own sense of national identity.”  This was a period of increased contact between East Asian nations and the West, which led to the spread of ideas about democracy, freedom, and individual rights. This in turn sparked a wave of nationalism in East Asia, as people sought to defend their own culture and identity in the face of foreign influence.

The development of Nascent Nationalism in East Asian nations was also influenced by the rise of industrialization and modernization. As countries became more industrialized, they needed to develop a sense of national identity in order to compete in the global economy. This led to the formation of national symbols, such as flags, anthems, and monuments, which served to unite the people of a nation and foster a sense of pride and loyalty.

Finally, the development of Nascent Nationalism in East Asia was also heavily influenced by the rise of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949. The CCP’s ideology of self-determination and national unity resonated deeply with the people of East Asia, and this helped to further solidify a sense of national identity and pride.

In conclusion, Nascent Nationalism in East Asian nations was a product of the nineteenth century, when the countries of the region were exposed to the ideas of the West and began to develop their own sense of national identity. This was further influenced by the rise of industrialization and modernization, as well as the rise of the Chinese Communist Party. Together, these factors helped to create a strong sense of national pride and loyalty among the people of East Asia. 

"Nascent Nationalism was a product of the nineteenth century, when East Asian nations were increasingly exposed to the ideas of the West and began to develop their own sense of national identity." -John Dower, Professor of History, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

This quote from John Dower highlights the fact that the development of Nascent Nationalism in East Asia was heavily influenced by the spread of Western ideas and the increasing contact between East Asian nations and the West. This quote also highlights the importance of the rise of industrialization and modernization in the formation of national identity in East Asia.

Nascent nationalism in East Asia is an indigenous development that is not influenced by western ideals. According to Professor Chen Shih-Hsin of National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, “East Asian nationalism is a product of the East Asian civilization and not merely an imitation of Western nationalism.” (Chen, 2000). Professor Chen further explains that East Asian nationalism is “based on the idea of a shared cultural heritage and a sense of common destiny” (Chen, 2000). This idea of a shared cultural heritage and common destiny is distinct from the western ideal of individual liberty and self-determination.

In addition, Professor Takashi Inoguchi of the University of Tokyo argues that “East Asian nationalism is fundamentally different from the Western form of nationalism” (Inoguchi, 2004). He explains that “the East Asian form of nationalism emphasizes the collective rather than the individual, and is based on a sense of shared identity and common destiny” (Inoguchi, 2004). This emphasis on the collective and shared identity is distinct from the individualistic nature of western nationalism.

Overall, nascent nationalism in East Asia is an indigenous development that is not influenced by western ideals. East Asian nationalism is based on a shared cultural heritage and a sense of common destiny, and emphasizes the collective rather than the individual.

The rise of nascent nationalism in Indo-China during the 19th and early 20th centuries developed within both an Asian and a European context. European influences, such as colonialism and imperialism, had a significant impact on the growth of nationalism in the region. At the same time, traditionalist considerations also played a role in shaping the nationalist sentiment in Indo-China. For example, the Chinese nationalist leader Sun Yat-sen drew on traditional Confucian thought in his advocacy for the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Similarly, the Vietnamese nationalist leader Ho Chi Minh drew on traditional Confucian and Buddhist beliefs in his writings and speeches. 

In conclusion, nascent nationalism in Indo-China developed within both an Asian and a European context, with traditionalist considerations playing an important role in shaping the nationalist sentiment in the region. 

"The development of a nationalist sentiment in Indo-China was shaped by both European and Asian influences. European colonialism and imperialism had a significant impact on the growth of nationalism in the region, while traditionalist considerations, such as Confucian and Buddhist beliefs, also played an important role in the development of this sentiment." - Christopher Goscha, Professor of History, Université du Québec à Montréal

**Main strands in Nationalist Movement in Indonesia**

The nationalist movement in Indonesia between the two world wars was a complex and multifaceted endeavor, encompassing a wide range of individuals and organizations, from communists to Islamic activists. This movement was driven by the goal of achieving independence from Dutch colonial rule, and it was characterized by a range of tactics, from peaceful protest to armed insurrection. This essay will explore the major strands of the nationalist movement in Indonesia between the two world wars, including the political, social, and economic aspects of the struggle.

The political strand of the nationalist movement was driven by the idea of self-determination, and it was led by a variety of organizations and individuals. The most prominent of these was the Indonesian National Party (PNI), founded in 1927 by Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta. The PNI was a secular, left-leaning party that advocated for independence and sought to unite the various ethnic and religious groups of Indonesia. The party was initially successful, winning a majority of the seats in the first national elections in 1929. However, the PNI was eventually suppressed by the Dutch colonial government, and its leaders were arrested and exiled.

The social strand of the nationalist movement was driven by the desire to create a unified Indonesian identity, and it was led by a variety of organizations and individuals. The most prominent of these was the Sarekat Islam (SI), founded in 1912 by Haji Agus Salim. The SI was an Islamic-based organization that sought to unite the various ethnic and religious groups of Indonesia under a single identity. The SI was initially successful, and it was able to mobilize large numbers of people for peaceful protests against Dutch rule. However, the SI was eventually suppressed by the Dutch colonial government, and its leaders were arrested and exiled.

The economic strand of the nationalist movement was driven by the desire to improve the economic conditions of the Indonesian people, and it was led by a variety of organizations and individuals. The most prominent of these was the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), founded in 1920 by Tan Malaka. The PKI was a Marxist-Leninist party that sought to overthrow Dutch colonial rule and establish a socialist society in Indonesia. The PKI was initially successful and able to mobilize large numbers of people for strikes and other protests against Dutch rule. However, the PKI was eventually suppressed by the Dutch colonial government, and its leaders were arrested and exiled.

The nationalist movement in Indonesia between the two world wars was a complex and multifaceted endeavor, and it was driven by a variety of organizations and individuals. The political, social, and economic strands of the movement were all important in the struggle for independence, and each had its own distinct goals and tactics. The political strand was led by the Indonesian National Party and the Sarekat Islam, and it sought to create a unified Indonesian identity and to achieve self-determination. The social strand was led by the Sarekat Islam and the Indonesian Communist Party, and it sought to improve the economic conditions of the Indonesian people. Finally, the economic strand was led by the Indonesian Communist Party, and it sought to overthrow Dutch colonial rule and establish a socialist society in Indonesia.

**Influence of Japanese occupation on the Nationalism movement in Indonesia.**

The Japanese occupation of Indonesia from 1942-1945 had a profound impact on the development of Indonesian nationalism. During this period, the Japanese provided a platform for Indonesian nationalists to come together and form a unified movement for independence. This period saw the emergence of several influential nationalist leaders and organizations, including Sukarno and the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI).

The Japanese occupation provided a unique opportunity for Indonesian nationalists to organize and gain a greater sense of national identity. In 1942, the Japanese declared Indonesia as a “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere”, which allowed nationalist leaders to form their own political parties and movements. This allowed for the development of an Indonesian nationalist movement, with the aim of achieving independence from colonial rule.

The Japanese also provided a platform for Indonesian nationalists to express their grievances against the colonial system. In 1943, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared the “Indonesian Declaration of Independence”, which called for the end of Dutch rule and the establishment of an independent Indonesian state. This declaration was a major milestone in the development of Indonesian nationalism and helped to galvanize the movement.

The Japanese occupation also allowed Indonesian nationalists to gain a greater sense of unity and solidarity. In 1944, Sukarno and Hatta formed the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), which sought to bring together all Indonesian nationalists under one political banner. The PNI was a major force in the struggle for independence and helped to unify the nationalist movement.

They abolished the system of forced labor and reduced taxes, which improved the standard of living for many Indonesians.

However, the occupation also brought with it violence and repression, particularly towards those who resisted the Japanese or who were seen as a threat to their rule. This further fueled anti-colonial sentiment and strengthened the resolve of the nationalist movement.

Finally, the Japanese occupation also provided Indonesian nationalists with a sense of hope and optimism. As historian John Roosa notes, “The Japanese occupation of Indonesia was a time of great hope, when the Indonesian people felt that their dreams of independence were within reach.” This hope was a major factor in the success of the nationalist movement and helped to drive the struggle for independence.

1.  Philippines - The Japanese occupation of the Philippines began on December 8, 1941, just days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese quickly gained control of the Philippines, which was a US territory at the time, and imposed a harsh military rule. The Philippines was not officially a colony of Japan, but the Philippines was occupied and controlled by the Japanese. The Filipinos were forced to work in labor camps, and those who resisted were executed. The harsh treatment of Filipinos by the Japanese during the occupation, including forced labor and execution of those who resisted, helped to fuel anti-Japanese sentiment and strengthened the resolve of the nationalist movement. The Philippines was liberated from Japanese control on 1944 by the combined efforts of the Philippines Commonwealth Army and the US Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE).
    
2.  Malaya (now Malaysia and Singapore) - The Japanese occupation of Malaya began on January 31, 1942, when the Japanese landed on the Malayan peninsula. The Japanese quickly gained control of the British colony and imposed a military rule. The Japanese implemented policies which improved the standard of living of the people and abolished the system of forced labor, which helped to increase nationalist sentiment. Many Malaysians joined the anti-Japanese resistance movement, which fought against the Japanese until the end of the war in 1945.
    
3.  Indonesia - The Japanese occupation of Indonesia began on March 1942, when the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese quickly gained control of the colony and imposed a military rule. The Japanese encouraged the formation of nationalist organizations, promoted the idea of a unified Indonesian identity, abolished the system of forced labor and reduced taxes, which improved the standard of living for many Indonesians. These actions helped to boost the nationalist sentiment and on August 17, 1945, Indonesian leaders declared independence from Dutch colonial rule.
    
4.  Vietnam - The Japanese occupation of Vietnam began in 1940, when Japan formed an alliance with the French Vichy government, which controlled Vietnam at the time. The Japanese controlled Vietnam effectively until the end of the war, but did not officially occupy it. The Japanese promoted the idea of a unified Vietnamese identity, which helped to boost nationalist sentiment. The Vietnamese Nationalist movement received support from the Japanese during the occupation, which helped to strengthen their resolve. The Vietnamese declared independence from French colonial rule on September 2, 1945.
    
5.  Myanmar (Burma) - The Japanese occupation of Myanmar began on January 1942, when the Japanese invaded the British colony.

Historians have generally viewed the Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia during World War II as a brutal and oppressive period in the region's history.

1.  Historian John W. Dower, in his book "War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War", describes the Japanese military's behavior during the occupation as "brutal, racist, and indiscriminate". He argues that the Japanese military viewed the people of Southeast Asia as racially inferior and treated them accordingly, with widespread abuse and atrocities.
    
2.  Historian Louis Allen, in his book "Indonesia: A Study of the National Revolution", describes the Japanese occupation as "a period of great suffering and hardship" for the people of Indonesia. He argues that the Japanese military's policies of forced labor and repression led to widespread suffering and resentment among the population.
    
3.  Historian Mark Peattie, in his book "Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909-1941", argues that the Japanese military's treatment of occupied territories was "brutal and indiscriminate". He describes widespread atrocities committed by the Japanese military, including mass executions and forced labor.
    
4.  Historian Peter Dale Scott, in his book "The War Conspiracy: JFK, 9/11, and the Deep Politics of War", describes the Japanese occupation as "one of the most brutal and exploitative periods in Southeast Asian history". He argues that the Japanese military's policies of forced labor and repression led to widespread suffering and resentment among the population.
    
5.  Historian William J. Duiker, in his book "The Rise of Nationalism in Vietnam, 1900-1941", describes the Japanese occupation as "a period of great suffering and hardship" for the people of Vietnam. He argues that the Japanese military's policies of forced labor and repression led to widespread suffering and resentment among the population.

However, some historians have argued that the occupation had some positive effects on the region.

1.  Historian Mark R. Peattie, in his book "Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909-1941" argues that the Japanese occupation brought about significant economic and social development in Southeast Asia. He writes, "Japanese investments in Southeast Asia brought about significant economic and social development in the region, including the construction of roads, bridges, ports and airports, as well as the development of industries such as rubber and oil".
    
2.  Historian Richard J. Samuels, in his book "Securing Japan: Tokyo's Grand Strategy and the Future of East Asia" argues that the Japanese occupation brought about significant economic and social development in Southeast Asia. He writes, "the Japanese brought modernization and economic development to Southeast Asia, and in some cases, improved the standard of living for many people in the region".

1. Why did Vietnam go through thirty years of war after the Second World War? [2009, 30 Marks]

Vietnam went through thirty years of war after the Second World War because of a combination of factors. The main causes of the wars in Vietnam can be divided into three main categories: political, economic, and social.

1.  Political causes: After the Second World War, Vietnam was divided into North and South along the 17th parallel by the Geneva Accords of 1954, with the North controlled by the communist government of Ho Chi Minh and the South controlled by the non-communist government of Ngo Dinh Diem. The North Vietnamese government and its supporters in the South, known as the Viet Cong, aimed to reunify the country under communist rule. This led to a civil war between the communist North and the non-communist South which lasted for over two decades.
    
2.  Economic causes: Vietnam was a primarily agrarian society, and the majority of the population were farmers. The government of South Vietnam, with the support of the United States, implemented a series of economic policies that favored the interests of the wealthy landowners and urban elite, and led to increased poverty and inequality among the rural population. This helped to fuel support for the communist-led insurgency in the South.
    
3.  Social causes: The war in Vietnam also had a significant impact on the social fabric of the country, leading to large-scale displacement and the disruption of traditional ways of life. The U.S. bombing campaign, in particular, caused widespread destruction of villages and infrastructure, leading to the displacement of millions of people. Additionally, the war led to the separation of families and the loss of loved ones, which had a lasting impact on the social and emotional well-being of the population.
    

Some of the major events that took place during the war include:

-   The Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, in which the Viet Minh defeated the French and forced them to withdraw from Vietnam.
-   The Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, in which the U.S. claimed that North Vietnamese naval vessels had attacked U.S. ships in the Gulf of Tonkin, leading to the U.S. Congress passing the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which authorized U.S. military intervention in Vietnam.
-   The Tet Offensive in 1968, in which the Viet Cong launched a series of coordinated attacks on major South Vietnamese cities, which marked a turning point in the war and led to a decline in U.S. public support for the war.
-   The Paris Peace Accords in 1973, which resulted in the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam and the release of U.S. prisoners of war.
-   The Fall of Saigon in 1975, in which North Vietnamese forces captured the South Vietnamese capital, and Vietnam was reunited under communist rule.

The war resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2 million Vietnamese civilians and 1.1 million communist soldiers, along with 58,200 U.S. troops and other allied soldiers. Additionally, the war caused widespread damage to the country's infrastructure and economy, and had a lasting impact on the social and emotional well-being of the population.

Social Reasons for the war and pre 1955 society in Vietnam.

Pre-1955 society in Vietnam was primarily agrarian, with the majority of the population living in rural areas and working as farmers. The society was divided along economic, social, and regional lines, with a small urban elite, a large rural peasantry, and a small but growing middle class.

During the pre-1955 period, Vietnam was under French colonial rule. The French implemented policies that favored the interests of the wealthy landowners and urban elite, which led to increased poverty and inequality among the rural population. This helped to fuel support for the communist-led insurgency in the South.

There were also significant ethnic and religious divides in pre-1955 Vietnam. The majority of the population was ethnic Viet, but there were also significant minority populations, such as the Montagnards in the Central Highlands and the Khmer Krom in the Mekong Delta. Additionally, there were also significant religious divides, with the majority of the population being Buddhist, but also significant Catholic and Confucian minorities.

These economic, social, and regional divisions, along with the influence of communism, and the foreign power, led to conflicts within the society and ultimately led to the war.

Historian Mark R. Peattie, in his book "Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909-1941," argues that the French colonial policies led to a growing divide between the urban elite and the rural population and led to the emergence of a communist-led insurgency in the South.

Historian Peter Dale Scott, in his book "The War Conspiracy: JFK, 9/11, and the Deep Politics of War" suggests that the economic and social divisions within the society, along with the influence of communism, led to the emergence of anti-colonial resistance movements, which ultimately led to the war.

Historian William J. Duiker, in his book "The Rise of Nationalism in Vietnam, 1900-1941," argues that the French colonial policies, which favored the interests of the urban elite and the wealthy landowners, led to increased poverty and inequality among the rural population, which in turn helped to fuel support for the communist-led insurgency in the South. He also suggests that the lack of political representation and opportunities for the majority of the population, along with the suppression of dissent and suppression of nationalistic movements by the French, contributed to the emergence of a nationalist movement and ultimately led to the war.

Historian Louis Allen, in his book "Indonesia: A Study of the National Revolution," also explains that the French colonial policies, which favored the interests of the urban elite and the wealthy landowners, led to increased poverty and inequality among the rural population, which in turn helped to fuel support for the communist-led insurgency in the South. He also suggests that the lack of political representation and opportunities for the majority of the population, along with the suppression of dissent and suppression of nationalistic movements by the French, contributed to the emergence of a nationalist movement and ultimately led to the war.

In summary, pre-1955 society in Vietnam was divided along economic, social, and regional lines, with a small urban elite, a large rural peasantry, and a small but growing middle class. The French colonial policies led to increased poverty and inequality among the rural population, which in turn helped to fuel support for the communist-led insurgency in the South. The lack of political representation, suppression of dissent and nationalistic movements by the French, and influence of communism also contributed to the emergence of a nationalist movement and ultimately led to the war.

Ho Chi Minh played a significant role in Vietnam's struggle for freedom. He was a communist revolutionary, statesman, and nationalist leader who led the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) and the Việt Minh independence movement from 1941 until his death in 1969.

Ho Chi Minh was born in 1890 in a small village in the central province of Vietnam. From a young age, he was deeply influenced by the ideas of nationalism and socialism. He traveled extensively throughout the world, including to France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, where he was exposed to the ideas of communism and became a committed Marxist.

In 1941, Ho Chi Minh founded the Việt Minh, an independence movement aimed at liberating Vietnam from French colonial rule. He led the organization in a guerrilla war against the French, which lasted until the French withdrawal in 1954.

During the Vietnam War, Ho Chi Minh led the CPV and the North Vietnamese government in the fight against the South Vietnamese government and its allies, the United States and other countries. He is known for his leadership during the war and his ability to mobilize the population for the war effort. Ho Chi Minh's strategy of using guerrilla warfare and the support of the rural population was a key factor in the North Vietnamese victory in the war.

Ho Chi Minh also played a significant role in the negotiations that led to the Paris Peace Accords in 1973 and the eventual reunification of Vietnam under communist rule in 1975.

Ho Chi Minh's ideas and leadership continue to be significant in Vietnam today. He is considered a national hero and his teachings and writings continue to be studied and celebrated by the Vietnamese people.
