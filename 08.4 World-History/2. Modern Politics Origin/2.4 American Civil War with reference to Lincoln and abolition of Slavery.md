This statement is attributed to Abraham Lincoln and reflects his complex and evolving views on slavery during the American Civil War. At the time he made this statement, Lincoln was focused on preserving the Union, which was under threat from the Confederacy, and slavery was a contentious issue that divided the country.

When Lincoln became president in 1861, he did not initially seek to abolish slavery. Instead, he believed that the preservation of the Union was the most important goal, and he hoped to achieve this by convincing the seceded states to return to the Union. However, as the war progressed, Lincoln began to realize that slavery was a major cause of the conflict and that it needed to be addressed in order to bring about a lasting peace.

In his famous Emancipation Proclamation, issued in 1863, Lincoln declared that all slaves in the Confederate states were to be freed. This was not only a moral step, but also a military one, as it weakened the Confederacy by removing a significant source of labor. Additionally, the proclamation helped to reframe the war as a struggle for freedom and human rights, rather than just a dispute over states' rights.

Lincoln's statement reflects his pragmatic approach to the issue of slavery. He recognized that slavery was a deeply divisive issue and that there was no easy solution. However, he was willing to take whatever steps were necessary to preserve the Union and bring about an end to the war.

It's worth noting that Lincoln's statement is not to be interpreted as a lack of concern for the abolition of slavery, but rather a reflection of his political beliefs and the circumstances that he was facing during the civil war, where his main priority was to preserve the Union. He knew that slavery was a moral wrong, and his actions and statements throughout his presidency reflects that, but he also knew that in order to achieve his ultimate goal, he had to address the matter with tact and with the understanding of the political landscape.

The American Civil War, which took place from 1861 to 1865, was a complex and multifaceted conflict with a number of issues at stake. Some of the key issues that were involved in the American Civil War include:

1.  Slavery: The issue of slavery was a major cause of the Civil War, as the Confederacy seceded from the Union in order to protect and expand the institution of slavery. The abolition of slavery was a key demand of the Union, and the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Lincoln in 1863 declared all slaves in the Confederate states to be free.
    
2.  States' rights: The Confederacy believed that the states had the right to secede from the Union, while the Union believed that the states did not have this right and that the Union must be preserved at all costs.
    
3.  Economic and social issues: The North and South had different economic systems, with the North being more industrialized and the South being more agrarian. This led to different social and economic issues and priorities, such as tariffs and trade.
    
4.  Political issues: There were also significant political differences between the North and South, with the South being more conservative and the North being more liberal. This led to disagreement over issues such as the role of government and the rights of individual states.
    
5.  Military strategy: The Union had superior resources and population, but the Confederacy had a strong military tradition and the advantage of fighting a defensive war on its own territory.
    
6.  Diplomatic issues: The Union's victory in the war had international implications as well, as it helped to preserve the Union and strengthen the position of the United States on the global stage.
    
7.  Human rights: The question of human rights of the enslaved population was a central issue, as it was the main cause for the war, and the Union's victory led to the abolition of slavery and the granting of civil rights to the former slaves.
    
8.  Re-construction: Once the war ended, the question of how to rebuild the South and integrate former slaves into society became a central issue.

The American Civil War (1861-1865) can be viewed as both a conflict between nations as well as a domestic conflict.

Arguments for viewing the Civil War as a conflict between nations:

1.  The Confederacy, made up of 11 southern states, declared itself a separate and independent nation from the United States.
    
2.  The Confederacy had its own government, constitution, and military, functioning as a separate entity from the United States government.
    
3.  The Confederacy was recognized as a sovereign nation by several foreign countries, including the United Kingdom and France.
    
4.  The war was fought between two distinct sides, the Union (Northern states) and the Confederacy (Southern states) and had clear geographical boundaries.
    
5.  The war was fought over issues of national sovereignty and self-government, such as states' rights and the right to secede.
    

Arguments against viewing the Civil War as a conflict between nations:

1.  The Confederacy never gained official recognition as a separate nation from the United States by the international community.
    
2.  The war was primarily fought within the territory of the United States and not on foreign soil.
    
3.  The war was primarily fought to preserve the unity of the United States and not for the purpose of creating a separate nation.
    
4.  The war was primarily fought over issues related to slavery, which is considered a domestic issue, not a national one.
    
5.  The Union never recognized the Confederacy as a separate nation, and the war was always referred to as a rebellion or insurrection, not a war between nations.

This statement is a reference to the end of the American Civil War and the preservation of the Union, the abolition of slavery and the survival of a nation "conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." The statement highlights the immense human cost of the war, with 600,000 men losing their lives, as well as the significant social and political changes that occurred as a result of the conflict.

The preservation of the Union was a crucial outcome of the Civil War, as it prevented the country from being permanently divided and ensured the continuity of the United States as a single nation. The Union victory also marked the end of the Confederacy, which had seceded from the Union in order to protect and expand the institution of slavery.

The abolition of slavery was one of the most significant outcomes of the Civil War, as it marked the end of a system that had been deeply ingrained in American society for centuries. It was a major step towards fulfilling the principle that "all men are created equal" and it led to the granting of civil rights to the former slaves, as well as the integration of African Americans into society.

However, it is important to note that the abolition of slavery and the granting of civil rights to the former slaves did not immediately lead to racial equality, as the country still faced many challenges in terms of racism and discrimination. The implementation of the reconstruction plans, which aimed to rebuild the South and integrate former slaves into society, was met with resistance and obstacles, and the end of the Civil War did not bring an end to the struggle for civil rights in America.

Moreover, the human cost of the war was staggering, with 600,000 men losing their lives. The Civil War was one of the deadliest conflicts in American history and it had a profound impact on the country and its people. The loss of life and the destruction of property left deep wounds that took many years to heal.

1. "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free" Explain Abraham Lincoln's perspective. [2016, 20 Marks]

Abraham Lincoln's perspective on the issue of slavery in the United States during the 1850s and early 1860s can be best understood through his famous quote, "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free." This quote, made during his speech accepting the Republican nomination for the U.S Senate in 1858, reflects Lincoln's belief that the issue of slavery would ultimately lead to the destruction of the United States if it was not addressed and resolved.

Lincoln believed that the United States, as a nation, was founded on the principles of freedom and equality for all. He argued that the existence of slavery, which denied basic human rights to a large portion of the population, was a fundamental contradiction to these principles and could not be reconciled with the nation's founding principles. He argued that the nation could not continue to exist as a "half slave and half free" nation, as it would ultimately tear the country apart.

Lincoln believed that slavery was a moral issue and that it was the duty of the government to abolish it. He argued that slavery was a violation of the natural rights of all human beings and that it was the duty of the government to protect these rights. He believed that the government had a moral responsibility to end slavery, and that it was not just a political or economic issue. He said “If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.”

Lincoln also believed that slavery was a political issue that threatened the unity and stability of the nation. He argued that the expansion of slavery into new territories, particularly in the West, would lead to a further division of the country and could potentially lead to a civil war. He believed that the issue of slavery needed to be resolved in order to preserve the unity and stability of the nation.

In addition, Lincoln also believed that slavery was a economic issue, he argued that slavery was not only morally wrong but also detrimental to the economic development of the nation. He believed that the abolition of slavery would lead to the growth of free labor and would benefit the economy of the nation.

In conclusion, Abraham Lincoln's perspective on the issue of slavery in the United States was shaped by his belief in the principles of freedom and equality for all. He believed that slavery was a moral, political and economic issue that threatened the unity and stability of the nation, and that it was the duty of the government to abolish it in order to protect the natural rights of all human beings and to preserve the nation.
