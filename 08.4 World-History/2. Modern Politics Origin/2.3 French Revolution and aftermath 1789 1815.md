**French revolution and aftermath, 1789-1815**

1. What were the ideals of the French Revolution of 1789? How far is it correct to say that it overthrew mercantilism and the surviving relics of feudalism and contributed to the political supremacy of the middle class? [1979, 60 Marks]
- [Reforms carried out](onenote:[[French]]%20Revolution%20and%20aftermath%201789-1815&section-id={BAF25296-16C1-46BC-85CA-B17A471F7C04}&page-id={71A43F68-40A4-4DC6-A842-5249B31D41D1}&object-id={B5E4F310-0758-476B-AD92-AA7E7A9F88AC}&3D&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/bbc8be5bd337910c/Documents/History%20Optional/World%20History/Part%20I/Modern%20Politics%20-%20Origin.one)

```ad-Answer

The French Revolution of 1789 was a period of radical political and social upheaval in France, which lasted for about a decade. The revolution was driven by a number of ideals, including:

1.  Liberty: The French Revolution was fueled by the idea of individual liberty and the belief that all citizens should have equal rights and be treated equally under the law.
    
2.  Equality: The revolution aimed to create a more equal society, where all citizens were granted equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their social class or status.
    
3.  Fraternity: The French Revolution emphasized the idea of fraternity or brotherhood among citizens, and sought to create a society where all people were united in their shared humanity.
    
4.  Democracy: The French Revolution aimed to establish a more democratic form of government, where power was vested in the people rather than in a monarch or other ruler.
    
5.  Nationalism: The French Revolution also had a strong nationalistic component, as it sought to create a strong, unified French nation-state.
    

It is correct to say that the French Revolution overthrew mercantilism and the surviving relics of feudalism in many ways. The revolution abolished feudal privileges, abolished the privileges of the nobility and clergy, and abolished feudal dues and tolls. The revolution also abolished the mercantilist economic system and the privileges of the merchants and manufacturers.

Additionally, the French Revolution contributed to the political supremacy of the middle class in several ways:

-   The revolution also established a more democratic form of government, where power was vested in the people, which allowed for greater participation of the middle class in politics.
-   The revolution also created new opportunities for the middle class in terms of education, employment, and economic advancement.

However, it is important to note that the French Revolution had a complex and tumultuous history, and the ideals and goals of the revolution were not always achieved. The revolution also led to a significant loss of life and much suffering, and its legacy is still the subject of ongoing debate and interpretation.

The role of philosophers in the French Revolution is widely acknowledged as having a significant influence on the minds of the people and the intellectual creed of the revolution. Here are ten points that highlight the role of philosophers in the French Revolution:

1.  Ideas of Enlightenment: The philosophers of the 18th century, such as Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Montesquieu, were heavily influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment, which emphasized reason, individual rights, and the need for social and political reform.
    
2.  Critique of absolutism: The philosophers of the 18th century were critical of the absolutist monarchy and the traditional social and political structures of France. They advocated for a more egalitarian and democratic society.
    
3.  Criticism of the Church and Religion: Many philosophers of the 18th century criticized the Church and the role of religion in society, arguing for the separation of church and state and the promotion of religious toleration.
    
4.  Critique of social inequality: Philosophers such as Rousseau were critical of the social inequality and the privileges of the nobility and the clergy, which they saw as unjust and detrimental to society.
    
5.  Popularization of ideas: Philosophers such as Voltaire and Rousseau popularized their ideas through their writings and speeches, which reached a wide audience and helped to create a revolutionary consciousness among the people.
    
6.  Inspiration for political action: The ideas of the philosophers of the 18th century served as inspiration for political action and provided a theoretical framework for the revolution.
    
7.  Role in the formation of political clubs: Philosophers played a role in the formation of political clubs, such as the Jacobin Club, which played an important role in the revolution.
    
8.  Contribution to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen: Philosophers such as Rousseau and Voltaire had a significant influence on the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which was adopted during the revolution.
    
9.  Role in the intellectual climate: Philosophers played a role in shaping the intellectual climate of the 18th century, which was characterized by a questioning of traditional authority and a desire for change.
    
10.  Legacy: The ideas of the philosophers of the 18th century had a lasting impact on French society and continue to influence political thought around the world.

```ad-Answer

The French Revolution of 1789 was one of the most significant events in modern history. It was a period of immense social and political upheaval, which saw the overthrow of the monarchy and the emergence of a new, revolutionary government. While the works of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu, certainly had an influence on the events of the revolution, they did not play a major role in producing the ‚Äúrevolutionary situation‚Äù that precipitated it.

The causes of the French Revolution were complex and varied. Many of the grievances of the French people had been simmering for decades, if not centuries. The monarchy had become increasingly out of touch with the people, and the gap between the wealthy and the poor had grown ever wider. The Enlightenment had certainly provided a philosophical foundation for the revolutionary ideas of the time, but the reality was that the people of France had reached a breaking point, and were ready to take action.

The economic situation of the country was also a major factor in the revolution. The country was in the midst of a financial crisis, and the government‚Äôs attempt to raise taxes only exacerbated the situation. This caused widespread discontent and a sense of injustice among the people, who felt that they were being unfairly taxed while the nobility and the clergy were exempt.

The ideas of the Enlightenment philosophers were certainly influential in the events of the French Revolution, but it was the combination of economic and social grievances that ultimately led to the revolutionary situation. The people of France had reached a point where they could no longer tolerate the status quo and were ready to take action. The works of the philosophers provided a philosophical foundation for the revolutionary ideas, but it was the people of France who made the revolution happen.

In conclusion, the works of the philosophers of the Enlightenment certainly had an influence on the events of the French Revolution, but it was the ‚Äúrevolutionary situation‚Äù that was the driving force behind the revolution. The combination of economic and social grievances created a situation where the people of France were no longer willing to tolerate the status quo and were ready to take action. The works of the philosophers provided a philosophical foundation for the revolutionary ideas, but it was the people of France who made the revolution happen.

The French Revolution (1789) had a number of ambitious goals and intentions, such as the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic, the abolition of feudalism and the privileges of the nobility, and the establishment of equality, liberty, and fraternity for all citizens. However, some historians argue that the revolution fell short of achieving many of these goals and that it failed to live up to its full potential. Here are ten examples of how the French Revolution fell short of its intended goals:

1.  Abolition of the monarchy: While the monarchy was abolished during the revolution, the revolution was ultimately unable to establish a stable republican government.
    
2.  Abolition of feudalism: While the revolution abolished feudalism, it failed to fully eliminate the privileges of the nobility and the clergy.
    
3.  Equality: While the revolution aimed to establish equality for all citizens, it failed to fully eliminate social inequality, as the rights and privileges of the nobility and the clergy were maintained.
    
4.  Liberty: The revolution aimed to establish individual liberty, but the Reign of Terror, led by Robespierre, resulted in widespread repression and the execution of thousands of people, which limited individual liberty.
    
5.  Fraternity: The revolution aimed to establish fraternity among citizens, but it ultimately resulted in widespread division and conflict, with different factions vying for power.
    
6.  Economic reform: The revolution aimed to improve the economic situation of the lower classes, but it failed to fully address the issue of poverty and inequality.
    
7.  Women's rights: The revolution aimed to promote equality for women, but it ultimately failed to fully address the issue of women's rights and gender inequality.
    
8.  Religious tolerance: The revolution aimed to promote religious tolerance, but it ultimately resulted in the persecution of religious minorities, such as the Catholics.
    
9.  International relations: The revolution aimed to promote democracy and freedom around the world, but it ultimately resulted in a series of costly and unsuccessful wars.
    
10.  Legacy: The revolution ultimately failed to establish a stable and lasting political and social system and it's legacy is mixed. While it resulted in some important reforms, such as the abolition of feudalism and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, it ultimately failed to fully achieve its goals of equality, liberty, and fraternity for all citizens. Furthermore, the revolution resulted in widespread violence and political instability, which had negative consequences for France and Europe as a whole. The revolution ultimately fell short of its intended goals, as it was unable to establish a stable and lasting political and social system and failed to fully address the issue of poverty and inequality.

```ad-Answer

French political writers of the 18th century, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and Montesquieu, were heavily influenced by the ideas of English philosopher John Locke.

1.  Natural rights: Locke believed that all individuals have certain natural rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, that governments are obligated to protect. This idea was influential in the French Revolution, as the revolutionaries believed that all citizens should have equal rights and be treated equally under the law.
    
2.  Social contract: Locke believed that individuals form governments through a social contract, in which they give up some of their natural rights in exchange for protection and security provided by the government. This idea of a social contract was influential in the French Revolution, as the revolutionaries believed that the government should be based on the consent of the governed.
    
3.  Limited government: Locke believed that the purpose of government is to protect the natural rights of individuals, and that government power should be limited in order to prevent tyranny. This idea of limited government was influential in the French Revolution, as the revolutionaries sought to establish a more democratic form of government with a separation of powers.
    
4.  Property rights: Locke's ideas about property rights and the right to own private property were also influential in the French Revolution, as the revolutionaries sought to abolish feudal privileges and the privileges of the nobility and clergy.
    
5.  Individualism: Locke's emphasis on the importance of individual freedom and autonomy also had an influence on the French Revolution, as the revolutionaries sought to create a society where all citizens were granted equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their social class or status.
    
It is important to note that while the ideas of John Locke were influential in the French Revolution, the revolutionaries also drew from other political thinkers and ideas, such as those of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu, and their own experiences and observations of the political situation in France. The French Revolution was a complex and multifaceted event, shaped by a variety of factors and influences.

The 18th century in France was a time of great political and philosophical change, as the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and liberty began to take hold. This period saw the emergence of some of the most influential thinkers of the time, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire, who helped shape the modern understanding of politics and society. At the same time, the writings of John Locke, an English philosopher, were becoming increasingly influential in France. Locke‚Äôs ideas, which included the notion of natural rights, the separation of powers, and the importance of consent in government, were seen as a way to challenge the absolutist rule of the French monarchy.

The French political writers of the 18th century were greatly influenced by Locke‚Äôs ideas, as well as by the contrast between the government of France and other countries. In particular, they noticed the stark differences between the French monarchy and the constitutional governments of England and the United States. The French writers saw the English and American governments as more progressive and democratic, and they sought to apply the same principles of government in France. They argued for a separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, as well as for the importance of individual rights and the consent of the governed.

The French political writers of the 18th century also sought to challenge the status quo of their own country. They argued for greater freedom of speech, the abolition of censorship, and the protection of individual rights. They also criticized the monarchy‚Äôs monopoly on power and argued for a more representative form of government. In addition, they advocated for the reform of the French legal system, which they saw as outdated and unjust.

The writings of these French political writers had a profound effect on the course of French history. Their ideas helped shape the French Revolution, which overthrew the monarchy and established a new system of government based on the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Their ideas also helped to spread the ideals of the Enlightenment across Europe, and eventually the world. The influence of Locke and the French political writers of the 18th century can still be seen in the modern world, as their ideas continue to shape our understanding of politics and society.

```ad-Answer

The statement "the religious and secular props of the existing social order" refers to the ways in which the traditional religious and political structures of France supported and maintained the existing social order.

The religious props of the existing social order refers to the Catholic Church, which was deeply intertwined with the political and social structures of France. The Church held significant wealth and land, and its clergy held privileges and exemptions from taxes. The Revolution sought to remove the Church's influence on society and politics, and to establish religious toleration.

The secular props of the existing social order also refers to the political and social structures of the Ancien R√©gime, which was the political and social system of France before the Revolution. This system was characterized by absolutism, with the king having absolute power, and the privileges of the nobility and the clergy. The Revolution sought to remove these privileges and to establish a more egalitarian and democratic society.

The French Revolution of 1789 was a period of great social and political upheaval in France that had far-reaching implications across Europe and beyond. The revolution was the culmination of a long period of social and economic unrest, brought about by the absolute monarchy of Louis XVI and the oppressive taxation policies of the Ancien R√©gime. It was a period of great political and social turmoil, marked by mass uprisings and civil unrest, as the people of France sought to overthrow the monarchy and establish a new form of government.

At the root of the revolution lay a deep discontent with the absolute monarchy of Louis XVI and his oppressive taxation policies. The French people were taxed heavily to finance the lavish lifestyles of the monarchy, while their own living conditions deteriorated. This led to widespread poverty, food shortages, and a sense of injustice and inequality. The people of France were further enraged by the monarchy's refusal to address the grievances of the people, and the lack of political representation and reform. In response, the people of France began to organize and take action against the monarchy.

The French Revolution was also inspired by the lofty ideals of the Enlightenment, which emphasized the importance of reason, freedom, and equality. During this period, philosophers such as Voltaire and Rousseau argued for the rights of the individual and for the establishment of a more just and equitable society. These ideas were taken up by the revolutionaries, who sought to establish a new form of government based on the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

The revolutionaries also drew inspiration from the American Revolution, which had taken place just a few years earlier. The American Revolution had shown that it was possible to overthrow an oppressive monarchy and establish a new form of government based on the principles of freedom and democracy. This example served as an inspiration to the French revolutionaries, who sought to emulate the success of the American Revolution and establish a new form of government in France.

The French Revolution was ultimately successful in overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a new form of government based on the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. However, it was not without its costs. The revolution was marked by violence and bloodshed, and the legacy of its legacy is still felt to this day. Nevertheless, it was a period of great social and political change, and its lofty ideals both inspired and sustained it.

```ad-Answer

The French Revolution was a period of great social and political upheaval in France from 1789 to 1799. It was a revolution that attacked the privileges of the aristocracy, the clergy and the monarchy, and sought to establish a more equitable society. The revolution was driven by a number of factors, including economic inequality, the power of the monarchy, and the influence of the Enlightenment.

The French Revolution was a direct attack on the privileges of the aristocracy. The aristocracy was a class of wealthy landowners who had been granted special privileges by the monarchy. These privileges included exemptions from taxes, exclusive rights to certain offices and positions, and the right to pass their titles and lands to their heirs. The revolution sought to reduce or eliminate these privileges, and to ensure that all citizens were treated equally under the law.

The revolution also attacked the privileges of the clergy. The Catholic Church was a powerful institution in France at the time, and it enjoyed a number of special privileges. These included exemption from taxes, the right to collect tithes, and the right to appoint bishops and other church officials. The revolution sought to reduce or eliminate these privileges, and to ensure that the Church was subject to the same laws and regulations as other citizens.

The revolution also attacked the power of the monarchy. The monarchy had absolute power over the French people, and the king was able to pass laws and make decisions without consulting the people. The revolution sought to reduce the power of the monarchy and to give the people more control over their own lives.

It was also influenced by the Enlightenment, a period of philosophical and scientific thought that emphasized the importance of reason and individual rights. The Enlightenment influenced the revolutionaries in their demand for equality and freedom from tyranny.

Aliter in Points 

The French Revolution is often said to have not attacked property but privileges because it aimed to abolish the privileges of the nobility and the clergy, rather than to abolish private property as such. Here are some reasons and examples that support this point:

1.  Abolition of feudalism: The French Revolution abolished feudalism, which was a system of land ownership and political and the clergy. This was done through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which abolished feudal rights and privileges, such as the right to collect feudal dues, but did not abolish private property as such.

2.  Rights of property: The French Revolution also recognized the rights of property through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which states that "property is an inviolable and sacred right." This shows that the revolution did not aim to abolish property as such, but rather to abolish the privileges and exemptions that certain groups, such as the nobility and the clergy, enjoyed with regard to property.
    
3.  Expropriation of Church lands: While the French Revolution did expropriate Church lands, this was done primarily to address the financial crisis and to redistribute wealth, rather than to abolish property as such.
    
4.  Taxation: The French Revolution also introduced a more equitable system of taxation, which aimed to tax the wealthy and the privileged more heavily, rather than to abolish property as such.
    
5.  The Reign of Terror: The Reign of Terror, which was a period of political repression and violence, did not specifically target property, but rather targeted those who were seen as enemies of the revolution, such as the nobility and the clergy.
    
6.  The Constitution of 1791: The Constitution of 1791, which was adopted during the revolution, also recognized the rights of property and did not aim to abolish it.
    
7.  Economic situation: The French Revolution aimed to improve the economic situation of the lower classes through measures such as price controls on food, but did not intend to abolish private property.

This statement is largely correct as the writings of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, such as Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, and Locke, had a significant influence on the minds of the people and played a key role in the intellectual creed of the French Revolution. Here are ten reasons to support this statement:

1.  The Enlightenment philosophers emphasized the idea of individual liberty, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for equal rights and freedoms for all citizens.
2.  The philosophers also emphasized the importance of reason and rationality, which helped to challenge traditional authority and superstition and paved the way for a more secular and scientific society.
3.  The Enlightenment philosophers also stressed the importance of democracy, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for a more democratic form of government.
4.  The importance of equality, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for a more equal society, where all citizens had equal rights and opportunities.
5.  Importance of individualism, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for a society where individuals were free to pursue their own interests and ambitions.
6.  Importance of citizenship, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for a society where all citizens had a voice and a role in the government.
7.  The importance of natural rights, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for the protection of the rights of the individual.
8.  The philosophers also stressed the importance of a social contract, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for a government that was based on the consent of the governed.
9.  The Enlightenment philosophers also emphasized the importance of limited government, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for a government that was limited in its power and accountable to the people.
10.  The philosophers also stressed the importance of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which helped to inspire the revolutionary demand for a society where individuals were free to express their opinions and ideas.

```ad-Answer

The French Revolution was a period of great change and upheaval in French society, politics, and culture, and it did not occur in an intellectual vacuum. Before, during, and after the Revolution, a number of influential thinkers and writers were actively engaged in debates about the nature of society, government, and the rights of man.

The Enlightenment, which began in the mid-17th century, was the intellectual backdrop to the Revolution. Enlightenment thinkers, such as Voltaire and Rousseau, argued for the natural rights of man and the need for a government that respected those rights. These ideas were influential in the formation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which was adopted during the Revolution in 1789.

The Revolution also saw the emergence of a new political philosophy known as Jacobinism. This philosophy was based on the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued for a strong central government that would ensure the rights of all citizens. The Jacobins, a political group during the Revolution, sought to implement these ideas. They were instrumental in overthrowing the monarchy and establishing the Republic, and their ideas had a lasting influence on French politics.

The Revolution also sparked a new wave of philosophical thought, particularly in the realm of social and political theory. Writers such as Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine argued for the rights of man and the need for a government that respected those rights. These ideas were influential in the formation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

The Revolution also had an impact on the arts and literature of the time. Writers such as Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas wrote works that celebrated the Revolution and its ideals. These works helped to spread the ideas of the Revolution and to create a sense of national identity.

The French Revolution was an event of unprecedented magnitude, and it did not occur in an intellectual vacuum. The ideas and debates of the Enlightenment, the emergence of Jacobinism, and the works of writers and philosophers all had an impact on the Revolution and its outcomes. The French Revolution was a product of the intellectual environment of its time, and it was shaped by the ideas and debates that were taking place in French society.

```ad-Answer

The connection between the philosophers' ideas and the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789) is a topic of debate among historians, with some arguing that the connection is remote and indirect, while others arguing that it is direct and significant. Here are five points in support of the statement that the connection is remote and indirect:

1.  Complex causes: The French Revolution was the result of a complex set of causes, including economic, political, and social factors, and the ideas of the philosophers were just one of many factors that contributed to the outbreak of the revolution.
    
2.  Limited reach: The ideas of the philosophers were primarily restricted to the educated elite, and it is unlikely that they had a direct impact on the mass of the population, who were primarily responsible for the outbreak of the revolution.
    
3.  Differing ideologies: The ideas of the philosophers were not monolithic and there were significant differences among them. This means that it's hard to see how a single set of ideas could have directly led to the outbreak of the revolution.
    
4.  Limited influence on events: The philosophers' ideas may have provided inspiration and a theoretical framework for the revolution, but they did not directly influence the specific events that led to the outbreak of the revolution.
    
5.  Political and economic factors: The outbreak of the revolution was primarily driven by political and economic factors, such as the financial crisis, the food shortage, and the rising discontent among the Third Estate.
    

On the other hand, here are five points in support of the statement that the connection is direct and significant:

1.  Intellectual climate: The ideas of the philosophers helped to shape the intellectual climate of the 18th century, which was characterized by a questioning of traditional authority and a desire for change, and this contributed to the outbreak of the revolution.
    
2.  Critique of the monarchy: The philosophers of the 18th century were critical of the absolutist monarchy and the traditional social and political structures of France, and this critique helped to pave the way for the revolution.
    
3.  Popularization of ideas: The philosophers of the 18th century popularized their ideas through their writings and speeches, which reached a wide audience and helped to create a revolutionary consciousness among the people.
    
4.  Inspiration for political action: The ideas of the philosophers of the 18th century served as inspiration for political action and provided a theoretical framework for the revolution.
    
5.  Role in the formation of political clubs: Philosophers played a role in the formation of political clubs, such as the Jacobin Club, which played an important role in the revolution.

1. "The multiple contradictions that quickly undermined the new edifice had been expressed even before the meeting of the Estate General in France. The internal conflict among Estates had manifested itself." Critically examine. [2015, 10 Marks]

```ad-Answer

The statement is referring to the internal conflict that was occurring within the Estates General in France before the meeting of the Estates General took place. This internal conflict was mainly between the three Estates (the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners) and was caused by the different interests, goals, and privileges of each Estate. This conflict eventually led to the French Revolution and the collapse of the French monarchy.

Points in favor of the statement:

1.  The different Estates (nobility, clergy, and commoners) in France had historically held different privileges and rights, which created conflicts and tensions between them.
2.  The financial crisis in France prior to the revolution had led to a growing discontent among the different Estates, particularly the commoners, who bore the burden of the majority of the taxes.
3.  The Enlightenment ideas, which were spreading in France, had led to a questioning of the traditional privileges and rights held by the nobility and the clergy.
4.  The meeting of the Estates General in 1789, which was called to address the financial crisis, quickly became a forum for the airing of grievances and demands for political and social reform.
5.  The Third Estate, which represented the commoners, demanded greater representation and more power in the government, which led to conflicts with the other two Estates.
6.  The National Assembly, formed by the Third Estate, declared itself the National Constituent Assembly and began drafting a new constitution, which further exacerbated conflicts with the other Estates.
7.  The growing power of the National Assembly and the demands for reform led to the fall of the monarchy and the rise of the revolutionary government, which further exacerbated conflicts between the different Estates.

Points against the statement:

1.  The financial crisis in France prior to the revolution was not just a problem of the internal conflict among Estates but also an outcome of the international economic and political situation.
2.  The Enlightenment ideas were not just limited to the French territory but had spread throughout Europe and the world, and the French Revolution was not an exception.
3.  The meeting of the Estates General was not only a manifestation of internal conflicts among Estates but also an opportunity for the monarchy to address the financial crisis and to seek the support of the different Estates.
4.  The Third Estate, which represented the commoners, was not united in its demands and some of the members had similar interests with the other Estates.
5.  The National Assembly, formed by the Third Estate, did not have a clear agenda and its actions were not always consistent with its declared goals.
6.  The fall of the monarchy and the rise of the revolutionary government did not immediately resolve the internal conflicts among Estates, but led to a complex and unstable political situation.
7.  The revolution was not just a product of internal conflicts among Estates but also had international and global dimensions and causes.

Condition of life on the eve of French Revolution 

One of the main issues was the country's high level of debt, which had been accumulated through years of war and extravagant spending by the monarchy. This debt had led to high taxes for the French people, particularly for the lower and middle classes, who were already struggling to make ends meet.

Additionally, France was facing a severe food shortage, which had been caused by a combination of factors such as poor harvests, population growth, and an inefficient food distribution system. This led to high food prices, which further exacerbated the financial struggles of the lower classes.

Furthermore, the country's economy was heavily dependent on agriculture, and the majority of the population was engaged in farming. However, the system of feudalism, which was still prevalent in France, meant that the majority of the land was owned by a small number of wealthy nobles, leaving the vast majority of the population landless and with limited opportunities for economic advancement.

Various other issues that people faced were : 

1.  High taxes: The French people, particularly those in the lower and middle classes, were facing high taxes due to the country's high level of debt, which had been accumulated through years of war and extravagant spending by the monarchy.

1.  Poverty: A large portion of the population lived in poverty, with limited access to basic necessities such as food, clothing, and housing.
    
2.  Inequality: The country's economy was heavily dependent on agriculture, and the majority of the population was engaged in farming. However, the system of feudalism, which was still prevalent in France, meant that the majority of the land was owned by a small number of wealthy nobles, leaving the vast majority of the population landless and with limited opportunities for economic advancement.
    
3.  Limited political representation: The French government was an absolute monarchy, and the majority of the population had no representation in the government, no voice in the decisions that affected their lives.
    
4.  Corruption: The monarchy and the government were plagued by corruption, with officials and nobles using their positions for personal gain.
    
5.  Lack of education: The majority of the population was illiterate and had limited access to education.
    
6.  Unfair legal system: The legal system was heavily biased in favor of the wealthy and powerful, with the lower classes often receiving harsher punishments for the same crimes committed by the upper classes.

Napoleon has been called the "child of the Revolution" because he rose to power during the French Revolution and was able to consolidate many of the gains of the revolution, including the establishment of a strong centralized government and the abolition of feudalism. He also spread the ideals of the revolution, such as nationalism and democracy, throughout Europe through his military conquests.

However, Napoleon also reversed many of the principles and aims of the revolution. One of the main principles of the revolution was liberty, equality and fraternity. Napoleon, however, established himself as a dictator and ruled with an iron fist, suppressing political opposition and dissent. He also reintroduced many of the privileges of the nobility that had been abolished during the revolution.

Another principle of the revolution was the idea of the sovereignty of the people. Napoleon, however, ruled as an autocrat and did not allow for a free press or free speech, and he also limited the power of local government and the role of the judiciary.

Furthermore, the revolution aimed to spread the ideals of the revolution across Europe and end the monarchies, Napoleon instead established himself as an Emperor and tried to spread the principles of his empire across Europe through military conquests.

Certain other ideals that he reversed were : 

1.  Napoleon restored the Catholic Church as the dominant religion in France, reversing the revolution's policy of religious toleration.
2.  He reintroduced a hierarchical social system, reinstating titles of nobility and a rigid class system.
3.  He centralized power in the government, reversing the revolution's emphasis on local control and democracy.
4.  He established a strong, authoritarian government, reversing the revolution's ideals of liberty and democracy.
5.  He reintroduced conscription and a large standing army, reversing the revolution's goal of ending the use of forced military service.
6.  He suppressed political dissent, reversing the revolution's emphasis on freedom of speech and assembly.
7.  He reintroduced the use of censorship and secret police, reversing the revolution's ideals of freedom of the press and expression.
8.  He returned to a system of government based on merit, rather than birth, but it was limited to the military and government officials, reversing the revolution's ideals of equality of opportunity.

1. The Napoleonic Empire was built on a highly centralized system of government, which gave the Emperor too much control over the daily lives of his citizens.

2. The Emperor's ambitious foreign policy, which sought to expand the empire, was unsustainable and eventually led to the overextension of French forces.

3. The Emperor's reliance on conscription to fill the ranks of his army, while providing a steady supply of soldiers, ultimately weakened the loyalty of the troops and led to desertions.

4. Napoleons's attempt to impose a single legal system on all of the territories he conquered, the Code Napoleon, created resentment among the conquered peoples and led to a breakdown of law and order.

5. His attempts to suppress opposition to his rule, including the use of secret police, created a climate of fear and distrust which undermined his legitimacy.

6 His reliance on taxation to finance his wars created a heavy burden on the people of the empire, leading to increased poverty and social unrest.

7. The Emperor's refusal to allow a representative assembly to debate and pass laws created a sense of alienation among the people, who felt that their voices were not being heard.

8. The Emperor's reliance on foreign allies, such as Spain, to support his wars, ultimately weakened his position as they were often unreliable and untrustworthy.

9. The Emperor's refusal to accept the terms of the Continental System, which was designed to isolate Britain, ultimately weakened the economy of the empire and led to a decline in trade.

10. His refusal to accept the terms of the Treaty of Amiens, which would have ended the war with Britain, ultimately led to the collapse of the empire.

1. To what extent did Napoleon's economic war with England become his undoing? [2010, 20 Marks]
- More content needed

```ad-Answer

During the Napoleonic Wars, France waged an economic war against England through several measures:

1.  The Continental System: In an effort to damage the British economy and protect French industry, Napoleon imposed a trade blockade on British goods and encouraged European countries to do the same.
    
2.  The Berlin Decree of 1806: This decreed that any ship that had docked in a British port would be considered a British ship, and would be seized if it entered a French or allied port.
    
3.  The Milan Decree of 1807: This decreed that any ship that obeyed the British orders would be considered a British ship, and would be seized if it entered a French or allied port.
    
4.  The Embargo Act of 1807 of US: This act, passed by the U.S Congress, prohibited American ships from trading with any foreign countries, effectively cutting off trade between the U.S and Great Britain.

Napoleon Bonaparte's economic war with England was a major contributing factor in his eventual downfall. The French leader's attempt to blockade Britain in order to cut off its trade and revenue, known as the Continental System, was a strategic blunder that had far-reaching consequences.

Napoleon's Continental System, which was imposed on Europe in 1806, was designed to prevent British goods from entering the continent. This was meant to damage England's economy and force the country to agree to French terms. However, the blockade was unsuccessful, as it led to a massive increase in smuggling and the British economy continued to thrive. Furthermore, the system had a negative impact on the economies of European countries, as they were now unable to import goods from Britain. This caused a great deal of economic hardship, particularly in the German states, which were forced to pay high tariffs to France.

The economic war also led to a number of military conflicts, as Britain sought to protect its interests and other European countries sought to oppose the blockade. This included the War of 1812 between the United States and Britain, which was a direct result of the Continental System. This war was costly and ultimately unsuccessful for the French, as it resulted in the loss of their North American colonies.

Furthermore, the economic war caused a great deal of political unrest in Europe, as countries began to resent French interference in their affairs. This led to the formation of the Sixth Coalition in 1813, which was an alliance of European countries opposed to Napoleon. This coalition was successful in defeating the French forces at the Battle of Leipzig in October of that year, marking the beginning of the end of Napoleon's rule.

In conclusion, Napoleon's economic war with England was a major factor in his downfall. The Continental System caused immense economic hardship for Europe, led to military conflicts, and sparked political unrest. These consequences ultimately resulted in the formation of the Sixth Coalition and the defeat of Napoleon's forces at the Battle of Leipzig. It is clear that Napoleon's economic war with England played a major role in his eventual undoing.

Napoleon Bonaparte is considered one of the most influential political leaders in history, known for his statesmanship and military genius. He rose to power during the French Revolution and became Emperor of France, leading his country through a period of great expansion and prosperity. However, his rule was also marked by conflict and ultimately ended in his downfall.

One of Napoleon's greatest achievements was his introduction of the Napoleonic Code, also known as the French Civil Code. This legal code abolished feudal privileges and established equality before the law, providing a uniform legal framework that still forms the basis of civil law in many countries today. It also abolished the privileges of the nobility and the clergy and granted freedom of religion.

Napoleon also introduced a number of administrative and economic reforms that modernized and centralized France. He established a strong and efficient government bureaucracy, reformed the tax system, and built a network of roads and canals, improving transportation and communication. He also promoted religious tolerance and the expansion of the French Empire, increasing French influence and power on the international stage.

Napoleon's military leadership was also remarkable, he led France to a number of victories during the Napoleonic Wars, conquering much of Europe. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history, known for his tactical brilliance and the ability to inspire his troops. Napoleon's victories in the battlefields brought glory and prestige to France and helped it to establish itself as one of the dominant powers of Europe.

However, Napoleon's rule also had a number of negative consequences. His aggressive expansionist policies led to prolonged and costly wars, causing significant loss of life and economic hardship. He also suppressed political dissent and reintroduced a system of government based on merit, rather than birth, but it was limited to the military and government officials, reversing the revolution's ideals of equality of opportunity.

Despite his many accomplishments and failures, Napoleon's impact on France and Europe was profound. His military victories and territorial expansion helped to establish France as a dominant power, while his administrative and economic reforms modernized the country and laid the foundation for its future development. His legal code had a lasting impact on legal systems around the world, and his influence on military strategy and tactics is still studied and debated today. However, his aggressive expansionist policies and disregard for human lives were also a significant drawback of his rule, and ultimately led to his downfall.
