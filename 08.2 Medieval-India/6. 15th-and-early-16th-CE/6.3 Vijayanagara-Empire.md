## PYQs

**The Vijayanagra Empire**

1. Give an account of the polity and society of Vijayanagara empire under Krishnadevaraya.
[1979, 60m]

```ad-Answer

The Vijayanagara empire was one of the most significant South Indian empires that flourished from the 14th to the 17th century. Krishnadevaraya, who ruled from 1509 to 1529, was one of the greatest rulers of the empire. His reign witnessed significant developments in the polity and society of the empire.

Polity
Under Krishnadevaraya, the Vijayanagara empire was a strong centralized state with an efficient administrative system. The king was assisted by a council of ministers and a group of officials who were responsible for the smooth functioning of the government. The empire was divided into provinces or Nadu, each headed by a governor or a Nayaka, who was responsible for collecting revenue, maintaining law and order, and implementing the king's policies.

Krishnadevaraya was a patron of art and literature, and his court was a center of cultural and intellectual activity. He was also an able military commander and expanded the empire's boundaries by conquering several neighboring kingdoms. He maintained cordial relations with the Portuguese, who were then in India, and encouraged trade and commerce.

Society
The society under Krishnadevaraya was hierarchical, with the king at the top and a vast majority of people at the bottom. The society was divided into four castes: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras, with the Brahmins enjoying the highest status. The king and the nobles were mostly Kshatriyas, while the merchants were Vaishyas, and the common people were Shudras.

The society was also marked by the presence of several religious communities, including Hindus, Jains, and Muslims. The Vijayanagara empire was a Hindu empire, and the majority of the population was Hindu. However, Krishnadevaraya was known for his religious tolerance and patronage of other religions. He invited scholars and artists from different parts of India, and his court was a melting pot of different cultures.

2. Discuss the origin of the Vijayanagara Kingdom. Do you agree with the view that Krishnadevaraya was an ideal ruler of this dynasty? [1980, 60m]

```ad-Answer

The origin of the Vijayanagara Kingdom can be traced back to the Sangama dynasty, which was founded by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I. They were brothers who were originally in the service of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, until it was defeated by the Delhi Sultanate in 1323. After the defeat, the brothers were taken to Delhi as prisoners, where they converted to Islam. However, they were released in 1336 and returned to their homeland, where they reconverted to Hinduism and established the Vijayanagara Kingdom.

The Vijayanagara Empire was founded on the principles of Hinduism and aimed to protect and promote the religion. The empire saw a period of great prosperity and growth under the rule of Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century. The empire's capital city, Vijayanagara, was a center of art, culture, and trade, attracting merchants and scholars from across the world.

There are differing views on the Vijayanagara Kingdom's impact on Indian history. Some argue that it was a significant force that protected Hinduism and Indian culture from foreign invaders. However, others see the empire as oppressive, particularly towards lower castes and non-Hindus, and an example of the exclusionary nature of Hindu nationalism.

Vijayanagar? [1983, 20m]

Krishnadevaraya's reign (1509-1529) is considered one of the most glorious periods in the history of the Vijayanagar Empire. He was a patron of arts, literature, and architecture, and his court was a center of learning and culture. During his reign, the empire reached its zenith of power and prosperity, with a vast empire that extended from the Deccan Plateau to the southern tip of India. 

Krishnadevaraya's military campaigns were successful, and he expanded the empire's territory by defeating neighboring kingdoms. He also maintained diplomatic relations with foreign powers, including the Portuguese and the Chinese.
