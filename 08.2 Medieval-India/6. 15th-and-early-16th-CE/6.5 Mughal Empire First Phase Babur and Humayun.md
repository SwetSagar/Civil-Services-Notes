- [ ] #todo

### Early Life of Babar and Struggle for Samarkand.

- There was a tripartite struggle for transoxiana/Samarkand which was captured by Sahbani khan after defeating Babar and late Mongol Khans to fixate his position at Samarkand.
- Unable to defeat Shaibani Khan he had to move towards Hindu Kush.
- @ Shaibani khan had used the Uzbek technique of Tulghuma/Wheeling tactics against Babar which he used against Ibrahim Khan.
- Babar captured Kabul and Ghazni in 1504 it gave him and his begs a breathing space.

> **Rushbrooke Williams** : He could turn eye his eyes west to Samarkand or east to Hindustan

- After he captured Kabul. Shahbani khan occupied Herat. Sensing trouble at frontier of Iran. Safavid Shah Ismail marched against him and defeated him at Merv.
- Babur forged good relations w/ Safavid Shah. And with the help of Persian army occupied Tranoxiana. But day to day interference by Persian on court made him aloof.
- Persian were defeated by Uzbeks later. Babur had to withdraw from Transoxiana and had to turn towards India. This was in 1514.

### Invasion of Hindu Kush and Conquest of India.

- Babar in his memoir has mentioned that he immediately made a move into Hindustan in 1504 but this was more of a foray to extract levies from Afghan chiefs.

#### Reasons for the Invasion of India

1. Babur's repeated failure to capture Samarkand as mentioned above.
2. Political Situation in India :
	- Sikandar Lodhi had died and the empire was split b/w Ibrahim and his brother Jalal. Ibrahim soon captured Jalal and executed him -> led to rebellion from older Afghan nobles.
	- Meanwhile Rana Sanga estd power in Eastern Malwa.
3. Revival of Power of Uzbeks around Transoxiana
4. Financial Difficulties :

	> **Abul Fazl** : Babur ruled over Badakshan, Kabul and Qandahar that did not yield sufficient income to maintain army
	- The revenue realised form exports and import of goods from Kabul was not enough to meet the needs of Babur, his begs and the army
- @ Bajaur expedition marked the beginning of Baburs efforts to conquer India. Babur used wholesale massacre against Bajauris who were mostly afghans which as per Rushbrooke Williams was to teach them a lesson.
- Babur had invaded India 4 times before Panipat. **Bhira** in 1519-20, **Sialkot** in 1520 and **Lahore** in 1524 and Panipat.
- B was invited by Daulat Khan Lodhi a noble to invade India expecting him to withdraw.

#### Battle of Panipat 20 April 1526

- Before Panipat in 1524 Babur started supporting Alam Khan's claim for Delhi to rival Ibrahim.
- Later Alam Khan revoked B support and along w/ Daulat Khan Lodi attacked Delhi but was defeated by Ibrahim.
- Babur by then had strengthened his flank by capturing Balkh and Kandahar.
- After reaching panipat he fortified his position by digging a ditch at his left and towards his right was Panipat city.
- ~ On the front he ussed the Rumi (Ottoman) method of joining carts together by ropes and b/w every two carts were breastworks used by matchlockmen to fire.
	- He was 1st in India to use artillery, Ottoman gunners Ustad ALi and Mustafa.
	- His mounted archers kept Ibrahim engaged while using the Tulghuma/ wheeling/ flanking the position of Ibrahim from sides and rear.
- Politically the battle was not decisive since he had to contend w/ powers of Rana Sanga and other Afghans.
- But it smashed the power of Lodis, gave him much needed treasures opened up the entire Gangetic valley upto Jaunpur to conquer.

#### Struggle w/ Rana Sanga of Mewat and other Problems of Babur

- Local population was very hostile since the sack of Delhi by Timur was still fresh.
- Many inhabitants had deserted towas and villages had taken to robbery.
- His begs found India to be a foreign country.
- ~ His 2 biggest dangers were Rana Sanga and the Eastern Afghans.
- ! Rana Sanga along with Hasan Khan Mewati and Mahmud Lodi made an alliance against Babur making a Rajput-Afghan alliance.
- B gave it a religious color by calling it a Jihad, renounced drinking wine, and after the war allowed Begs to go back to Kabul if they wanted.
- $ Ferishta and Badauni talked about the fear among Baburs men of the Rajput army.
- & They met at Khanwa on 17th March 1527. Where Babur emerged victorious. #important
- At Khanua he used the same tactics as Panipat of Rumi and Tulghuma. RS had not learnt from B's win at Panipat.

  > **Rushbrooke Williams** : Powerful confederacy of Mewar was shattered by a single defeat and ceased to become a dominant factor in politics of Hindustan.

- The Afghans under Nusrat Shah coalesced against Babur but were defeated.

#### Consolidation of Rules and Subjugation of Regional Rulers

- B first dealt w/ Afghan iqtadars or commanders of forts, towns on countryside. Followed a policy of force and concilliation by giving them parganas at different places.
- Afghans of Eastern UP who have been rebellious even against Ibrahim were tried to be conquered by sending Humayun but he later withdrew against Sanga's threat.
- Bihar and Bengal : Afghan rebels saw these areas as sanctuaries where they could retreat/regroup to resist Mughals. B. defeated these Kingdoms at battle of Ghaghra in 1529.

### Significance and Impact of His Advent

- Political : Indian became center of Central Asian politics, earlier Afghanistan used to be the base of operations now Delhi became hub of strategic control and foregin policy.
- Economic : Strengthened India's foreign trade and inc IN share in Central Asian Trade.
- Introduced use of cannons/artilery and muskets. New methods of fighting, skillful generalship, organisation etc was introduced.

- Various Timurid princes such as Zaman Mirza who had joined B after being expelled from Uzbek.
- @ His brothers such as Kamran's airs of independence. Kamran soon after B death occupied Lahore. Humayun was more concerned with Eastern Afghans so he confirmed it and also gave him Hisar Firouza as Iqta. This encouraged his other brothers Askari and Hindal.
- Eastern Afghans from UP, Bihar, Bengal which culminated into his defeat by Sher Shah in 1535.
- Bahadur Shah of Gujarat.

- H looked to SS as merely another Afghan chief but SS thought of himself as an independent ruler.
- H wanted to capture Bengal due to its vast treasures and to try recreate the Delhi Sultanate. Plan was ill conceived
- Sher Shah's prestige had greatly increased after his victory in Surajgarh over Mahmud Shah of Bengal and earlier in 1532/33 over Nusrat Shah.

- @ Humayun was defeated first at Battle of Chausa/Karmansa in June 1539 after Kamran had refused to help with troops and again at Kannauj May 1540.
