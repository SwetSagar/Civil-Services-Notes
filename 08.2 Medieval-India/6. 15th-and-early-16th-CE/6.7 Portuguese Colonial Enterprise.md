## Establishment of Portuguese Control in Indian Seas and Its Economic and Political Impact

- Vasco da Gama 1498 landed at Calicut guided by Abdul Majid.
- A direct sea link would displace monopoly of Arabs and Turks over trade in eastern goods esp spices.
- Along with commercial there were Religious reasons too since Muslims were traditional enemies of Christianity.
- @ Henry the Navigator sent 2-3 ships every year for exploration. Genoese merchants used to buy goods from Arabs and sold it in Europe but after capture of Constantinople by Turks their trade stopped so they further fuelled exploration of a route to India.
- Renaissance created a spirit of daring
- Economic growth led to dietary changes.

### Portugues Estado Da India
