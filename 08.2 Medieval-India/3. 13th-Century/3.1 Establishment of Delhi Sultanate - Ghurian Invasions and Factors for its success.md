- Invasions of Mahmud of Ghazni were actual precurosrs of the beginning from 1000 AD - 1030 AD, brokedown IN resistance

### Ghurid Invasions

- objective to gain control over Punjab and Sindh, through Gomal pass, conquering Peshawar, Ucch and Multan by 1179
- attacked Bhatinda in 1191 but defeated returned to defeat the Chauhan Rajputs at Tarain 1192
- ! 1st Battle of Tarain : Ghori aka Muizzuddin Muhammad bin Sam captured Tabarhinda fort, P defeated G,
- ! 2nd Battle : 1192
    - $ Minhaz Siraj, Ferishta's, Hasan Nizami accounts are sources

- Jayachandra Ghadavala dyn defeated and Banaras, Asni captured
- By end of 12 C most doab, Bundelkhand captured
- Under Bakhtiar Khalji Magadha and Bengal were subdued

### Reasons for Turkic Success

- **Lack of centralized power** : After fall of GP empire, no single state took its place.
- **Small states** : Gahadavalas in Kannauj, Parmaras in Malwa, Chalukyas in Gujarat, Chauhans in Ajmer, Tomars in Delhi, Chandellas in Bundelkhand rose but they quarreled among themselves
- peculiar social hierarchy
    - $ **Fakhr Mudabbir** in his Adab-ul Harb wa'al Shuja excluded majority of pop from mil training, concept of untouchability led soldiers who were high caste do all of the menial works themselves
- Use iron stirrup and horse shoes increased striking power,mobility and stamina of cavalry
- Area around Ghur was rich in iron, tradition of weapons production
- constant feud b/w states of central Asia - to their militarisation,
- horses well bred, cavalry skilled, fast moving, Elephants slow moving
- **Ghazi spirit** -> defending and spreading Islam
- **Iqta system** -> to collect land revenue, taxes only, was to furnish troops to the sultan
- Subuktigin defeated the Hindu Shahi ruler Jayapal annexed Kabul and Jalalabad paved way for early inroad.
- Ghazni gave patronage to Firdausi.
- Invasions period was of great flux and confusion

### Consolidation

#### Aibak (1206-1210)

- ! Moved capital to Lahore to counter **Yalduz** also defend against Khwarizm shah
- Expansion -> Foundation of Turkish Rule in Upper Ganga
- Aibak governor of Hissar Sirsa, captured Delhi in 1192 on the pretext of rebellion from Tomars similarly Ajmer annexed
- Jaichand of Ghadavals rejoiced P's defeat did not help the Dor Rajputs - Defeated in 1194 Asni/Fatehpur and Varanasi plundered
- From 1194-1198 Bayana, Gwalior, Kalinjar, Mahoba, Khajuraho captured
- Kannauj captured in 1198
- Turkish power was still limited were not able to hold positions

#### Ghazni Compared to Ghori

- Ghazni a better General never lost a battle.
- Ghori had political realism, sense of purpose, not afraid to change plans.
- Both used religion, gathered wealth to fund Central Asia campaign, enriched their Buildings.

#### Problems Faced during Consolidation

- Rebellion of ousted rules esp Rajputs
- Factionalism in Turkish nobility - political instability ex in Multan, Sindh, Lakhnauti
- Central Asian crisis after death of Ghuri
- Rise of Mongols + deprivation of support from Ghur prevented further expansion

# The Mongol Problem

>  KA Nizami Indian response in 3 distinct phases : **aloofeness**, **appeasement** and **resistance**

1. **Aloofness** : by Iltutmish, alliance of Mangbarni and Khokhars of Punjab was dangerous for Iltutmish he was also aware of the weakness of his new formed state
		- $ avoided political alliance with Khwarizm prince even leading an expedition against him as per Minhaz Siraj
2. **Appeasement** from Razia's reign 1236 continued till 1260* inspite of the invasion threat from the Khan of Transoxiana
3. **Resitance** from Balbans reign used both force and diplomacy
	    - reinforced forts at Bhatinda, Sunam and Samana and captured Multan, Uchh
- @ Mongols under Qutlugh Khwaja ravaged Del during *Khalji's reign 1303
- AK recruited huge standing army, repulsed them 1306, 1308
- successful defence of IN and Mongol destruction of Central Asia saw migration of scholars, mystics, artisans
