```ad-Answer

1.  Military culture: The Rajputs were primarily a military caste, and their society was centered around the military. They were skilled in warfare, horsemanship, and archery, and placed a great emphasis on personal honor and bravery.
    
2.  Ruling classes: The Rajputs were a ruling class in medieval India, with their own kingdoms and principalities. They were often divided into numerous clans, each with its own ruling family.
    
3.  Patriarchal society: The Rajput society was largely patriarchal, with male members holding most of the power and authority. Women were considered subordinate to men and were not allowed to participate in warfare or hold positions of power.
    
4.  Joint families: The Rajputs had a tradition of living in joint families, with several generations living together under one roof. The eldest male member of the family was the head of the household and had the final say in all matters.
    
5.  Feudal society: The Rajputs lived in a feudal society, with the king or ruler at the top, followed by a hierarchy of nobles and vassals. The nobles were expected to provide military support to the king in exchange for land and other privileges.
    
6.  Rajput chivalry: The Rajputs had a code of chivalry called "Rajputana dharma," which emphasized bravery, honor, and loyalty. The Rajputs were expected to protect the weak and defend their honor at all times, even if it meant going to war.

weaknesses were:

Lack of political unity among different Rajput states
Lack of economic resources due to lavish spending and frequent plundering by foreigners
Lack of moral and ethical flexibility in warfare, such as adhering to rigid codes of conduct and not adopting new techniques or strategies
Lack of cultural openness and curiosity, such as not learning from other civilizations or religions

1.  Satish Chandra: According to Satish Chandra, a noted Indian historian, the primary cause of the Rajput defeat was their inability to adapt to changing military tactics. The Mughals introduced new technologies and tactics that the Rajputs were unable to match.
    
2.  Jadunath Sarkar: Jadunath Sarkar, another prominent historian, argued that the Rajputs were too proud and chivalrous, which made them vulnerable to Mughal military tactics. The Mughals were more pragmatic and willing to use deception and surprise to win battles.
    
3.  R. C. Majumdar: R. C. Majumdar, a well-known historian of medieval India, believed that the Rajputs were weakened by their internal divisions and infighting. This made it difficult for them to unite and mount an effective resistance against the Mughals.
    
4.  K. S. Lal: K. S. Lal, a controversial historian, argued that the Rajputs were not defeated by the Mughals due to their military prowess, but because they were weakened by centuries of internal decay and corruption.
