```ad-Answer

Gender was one of the multiple axes of social inequality in medieval India, along with caste and community. Patriarchal structures, customs and institutions varied among different castes and regions, creating distinct conceptions of wifehood, motherhood, love, sexuality and filial relationships. The high-born castes imposed strict norms on womenâ€™s behavior, while the lower castes and tribal societies had more flexible traditions. However, women were generally subordinated to men in all social strata, and the state often supported this agenda.
