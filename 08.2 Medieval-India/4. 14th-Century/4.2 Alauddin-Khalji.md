AK as a despotic Ruler

- Barani criticises for his policy of excessive bloodshed, harsh and tyrannical behaviour, puts hardships on others to obey his orders
- [x] #todo

```ad-Views
**Dr. Ishwari Prasad** : “The reign of Ala-ud-Din represents the high watermark of despotism.” 

**Lane-poole** calls Ala-ud-Din “a bloody and unscrupulous tyrant. He has summed up the personality and rule : “Though he might be wrong-headed and disdainful of the low, he was a man of determination, who knew his own mind, saw the necessity of the situation, met it by his own methods, and carried out those methods, with persistence.”

“In the words of **Dr. V.A. Smith**, “He was particularly a savage tyrant— exceedingly disgraceful in many respects.”

## Alauddin Khalji's Agrarian Reforms

### Source

- Barani is source
    - 3 groups of rural aristocracy **khut (replaced ranas/rais at district/pargana level)** , **muqaddam**, and **chaudhuri** who collected land revenue called Kharaj
    - were given perquisites (haqq-i khoti) remuneration by state also took some share from peasants (qismat-i-khoti)
    - Every cultivator pay house tax called Ghari, grazing tax - charai
