## Reasons for the Decline of the Sultanate

1. & no clear, well defined **law of succession** dev in Sultanate, no primogeniture

4. Revenue assignments slowly became hereditary and permanent and the iqtas started to be sub assigned â†’ increased regional ties and corruption
5. & Rise of Regional states viz Bahmani kingdom was estd in 1347 AD. Timurid invasion 1398 exsposed this weakness. Bengal, Malwa and Jaunpur soon followed suit
6. mongol threat led to inc in expenditure in army, constant vigilance but it did NOT significantly weaken the kingdom.
7. Struggle b/w Price Muhammad and Khan I Jahan II (lost), Corp of slaves also a major party - defeated and dispersed, Nasirudding Mahmud only stable last of Tughlaq dynasty.
