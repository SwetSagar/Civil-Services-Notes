## Administrative Reforms

### Transfer of Capital 1328



#### Reasons

- Devagiri/Daulatabad centrally located, pleasant climate
- Ibn Batuta - wanted to teach people of Delhi lesson for writing abusive letters Woolseley Haig has accepted this verison. Isami says that MBT wanted to break the power of the citizens
- Gardner Brown and AL Srivastava says that reason was Mongol threat
- Revolt in Mabar, Bubonic plague outbreak soldiers perished, rumour of MBT's death - Mabar, Dwar Samudra, Warangal became independent
- Poets like Khusrau had created a beautiful picture of Devagiri
- Sultan wanted to create another administrative, cultural centre for Muslim in the Deccan as per Habibullah and Mahdi Hussain
- KA Nizami says that he wanted to have both Delhi, Daulatabad as capital
- Barani exaggerates - led to ruination of Delhi
- Ferishta - more familiar w/ it, already one of the great cities
- Effects largely felt by upper sections,


#### Reasons for Failure :

- People had to cover a distance of 1500km. Barani says it left Delhi in complete ruins
- He should have shifted only his court
- Isami says that Delhi was to be set on fire.


### Khorasan Expedition

- Raised a large army of 380,000 people, paid them in advance
- Make Sindh-Punjab free from M(Chagtai) invasion
- Barani - no care to enforce branding of horses or huliya, testing their swordmanship,
- Kept idle for 1 yr then disbanded

### Qarachil/Kullu Kangra Region of Himacha; Expedition

- Soon after Khorasan
- Ferishta says this was to conquer China
- Almost entire army perished
- Barani wrongfully said - aimed to get horses from Turkistan
- Not total failure, local ruler accepted overlordship

### Deccan Policy

- Wanted to annex Deccan, was very oppressive
- Dwarsamundra of the Hoyasalas was devasted and caused discontent among Hindu population

## Economic Reforms

### Use of Token Currency 1329-30

- Copper and Brass coins (Tanka)
- To raise a huge army, shortage of silver/gold coins (Jital)
- Reform coinage
- Dr Ishwari Prasad - unequalled in artistic perfection in design
- China under Mongols/ Kublai Khan and Iran's Qai Katu had intro paper currency
- Barani - recruit huge army to capture world, supplement treasury
- Muhammad Habib - Broze coins had inscription in Persian, Arabic; people could not distinguish b/w these and forged ones

#### Mistakes

- Did not employ measures to check faking, could not prevent forging
- Barani mention that house of every Hindu became a mint.
- People started hoarding silver and gold coins
- Withdrawing caused exchange of fake coins too causing loss to treasury but most fake coins were not accepted
- Large amounts accumulated, their value depreciated
- Trade Commerce disrupted

#### Historiography

- Irfan Habib has blamed citizens for not being able to distinguish b/w original and fake
- Mahdi Hussain has called it to be successful and decision statesmanlike
- Other historians have blamed the sultan

### Bribing the Mongol

- General Tarmashirin was bribed 500 dinars
- Shows his weakness
- Might not be true but it shows that Mongols were unchecked in region

# Agrarian Measures

## Agrarian Reforms

- Mohammed bin Tughlaq introduced new abwabs/ cesses and revived the older ones like charai, gharai etc but did not tamper the rate fixed by Alauddin.
- @ assessment carried out not on actual yield but on officially decreed yields called **wafa-i-farmani** and **mirkh-i-farmani** were used.
- extended sys of revenue collection to Gujarat, Malwa, Deccan, South India and Bengal.
- Cattle were branded.
- demand for revenue inc led to revolt around Delhi and doab.
- @ introduced the practice of giving agricultural loans named sondhar.
- new minister called **Diwan-i amir-i Kohi** was estd for promote agriculture

- Brief Experiment for reclamation of barren land through rotation of crop - estd of Diwan in Kohi
    - 60 sq miles area designated, 70 lakh tanka allocated
    - Funds misappropriated, dept wound up after 3 yrs

### Heavy Taxation of the Doab

- To raise a strong army, People were rich and could pay more taxes.
- $ Per Barani it was 20x the normal. Ferishta says 3-4 times. Gardner Brown says it was normal. AL Srivastava says about 5-10 percent. JL Mehta says 20%.
- Rains had failed during the time and there were famine like conditions. Barani says many perished, Brown doesn't.
- Farmers suffered, left their land, riots and rebellions broke out.
- ! Suppression was ruthless, later recalled and paid reparations. AL Srivastava says that it came too late.
- ! Charai and Gharai were already unpopular their collection became rigorous, usual revenue collected also decreased, made MBT unpopular; new cesses were also levied.
- For assessing yield standard yield was taken not actual produce, Price were not actual but decided by officials - destruction of Peasantry
- $ Barani : enforcement was so rigorous that feeble and low among riyaya were wiped out, rich ones became rebellious.
	- Bitterly criticises Sultan for this but never tells the actual amount by which it was inc, account of suffering of peasants in exaggerated
	- Confuses principal points in story by over emphasising relationship b/w Doab, Spread of famine and widespread revolt.
- Famine occurred during the same time, MBT advanced loans to dig wells, buy seed implements.
- Diwan I Amir I Kohi set up to extend cultivation, bring barren land under cultivation not uncultivable land aka **Usar**, improve crops.
- Total 70 lakh tankhas advanced as loans, Afif says 2cr.
- $ Barani - Entire scheme failed, person to implement were incompetent
- $ MBT died and FST wrote off the loan
- Not total failure -> helped evolve agri policy that fully matured under Mughals
