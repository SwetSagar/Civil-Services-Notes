---

 **Phase 1 (1658-1679)**

- Courtiers were asked not wear silk gowns or silk-cotton gowns.
- Throne room was furnished with cheap materials, use of porcelain ink stands instead of silver ones.
- Dept of History writing was discontinued as being a strain on economy.
- These steps were mostly due to financial crisis created due to civil war and drought. But he also forbade collection of Rahdari/ transit tax.
- Pandari/ ground rent for stalls in the bazar in the capital etc was abolished so was the octroi duty on tobacco.
- Reduced import of goods by Muslim traders and later abolished it but later reimposed it at a lesser rate.
- Karoris of all crown lands should be Muslims and all governors and local officials were asked to dismiss their non Muslim Diwans and clerks but was later withdrawn due to paucity of competent Muslims.
- He gave orders on no construction of New Hindu temples since he looked them as centres of spreading subversive ideas not acceptable to orthodox elements. But there was no orders for general destruction of temples.
- But destruction of temples was common during wards.
- But he also gave grant to gurudwara of Guru Ram Das at Dehra Dun, grants to vaishnava temples in Vrindavan continue, same with grants to jogis at Jakhbar in Punjab.
- Old mosques were to be repaired and imams and muezzins were appointed on regular salary as a reward for the theologians for their support.
- 22 years after his crowing Jizya wa re imposed on account of political considerations not to promote faith or sharia.
- Manucci says that he was motivated by the needs to replenish his treasury and compel poorer Hindus to convert to Islam.
- The income form Jizya was put in a separate treasury and disbursed among the needy Muslims. It bore the most on the lowest class with property less than 200 dirham.
- Reimposing it was meant to serve his purpose of cementing his alliance with theologians. It was bitterly resented by the Hindus who considered it as mark of discrimination. The payee was to personally come and pay and suffered humiliation in the process. The collectors misappropriated Jizya money and Hindu shopkeepers organised hartals.
---

**Phase II 1679-1707**

- He tried to project himself as the asylum of Muslims who only honours the non but people of true faith.
- Deccani rulers were labelled as lustful and sinful for allying with the Marathas.
- To win over parts of Telangana, Karnataka Bhimsen a contemporary historian tells that the area is full of temples but except a few cases Aurangzeb made little attempts to destroy them for fear of rousing futher opposition.
- A sent large amounts of money to mecca but stopped it at the corrupt and graspings ways of the theologians.
- Started recruiting more Marathas into his service in the later half of his reign.

### The Decision that He Took against Hindus Were

- demolition of Hindu temples which were newly constructed within the Empire. During Shah Jahan's reign it was limited to the Benaras region only. He also instructed the old temples were not to be repaired.
- In 1670, a farman was issued that all temples constructed in Orissa "during the last 10 or 12 years, whether with brick or clay, should be demolished without delay".
- Some temples that were destroyed were Vishwanath temple of Banaras, the Keshav Rai temple of Mathura and the "second temple of Somnath".
- When he was viceroy of Gujarat he destroyed the newly made Chintaman temple and deliberately killed cows.
- His imposition of Jiziya in 1679 has been seen as bigotry by some. But Satish Chandra has called this a political move to gain the support of the Muslims and boost their morale for his Deccan conquest. It could also have been to curb the financial crisis.
- He ordered Farmans in 1665 asking Hindus to pay 5% custom duty on goods as compared to 2 and 1.5% by Muslim merchants. Another Farman issued in 1671 said that revenue collectors of Khalisa lands were to be only Muslims.
- He allowed Hindus to employed only if their numbers were half that of the Muslims.
- In constrast to these. The Hindu mansabdars incerased and was one of the highest ever. He employed them in high posts as governors of Subahs. He also issued grants for maintenance of temples and priests.
- His actions might have emanated from deep guilt of killing his brothers and imprisoning his father and violating the turah i chagatai ie ascending to the throne while the reigning monarch was still alive.

### Rajput Policy of Aurangzeb

- Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Marwar had died without leaving a male heir. he also owed money to the state.
- Aurangzeb issued orders that state of Marwar including Jodhpur should be taken into Khalisa and a detailed inventory be prepared of the property left behind Jaswant Singh.
- This was not new escheat was common during the time.
- He decided to March personally to Ajmer since after his death the zamindars and other elements who had been subject to him withheld their revenue. The were creating disturbance and road to Ahmedabad had become unsafe.
- Indra Singh, Anup Singh were claimants to the throne. Rani Hadi wanted to keep Jodhpur as it was the watan of Jaswant Singh. She wanted to delay any decision by Aurangzeb until the other 2 Ranis of Jaswant Singh who was in advanced stage of pregnancy would birth. Rani Hadi was supported by Rathors and Raja of Mewar.
- After the birth of 2 posthumous sons of Jaswant Singh their support for claim increased.
- But Aurangzeb gave the gaddi of Marwar to Indra Singh for peshkash of 36 lakh rupees.
- A qazi and muhtasib was appointed to Jodhpur, Jizya reimposed and old temples were systematically destroyed.
- A wanted to split the Marwar among Indra SIngh and Ajit SIngh, new born son of Jaswant SIngh. Ajit Singh was to be given Sojat and Jaitaram which had significantly less income than Jodhpur and Nagaur -> shows the apprehension in mind of A about Rajputs.
- Rathor sardars rejected these demands after which A ordered the princes and their mothers to be put to confinement.
- Rajput sardars escaped with one of the sons to Jodhpur. After which Indra Singh and the Mughals were ousted from areas such as Jaitaran and Siwana but not Merta.
- Aurangzeb put an end to this after moving to Ajmer. The Rathor rajputs dispersed to desert areas and Anuj Singh found refuge in Mewar.

#### Breach with Mewar

- Mewar was subject to much restrictions such as Chitoor fort was not to be repaired, some of the areas around it was sequestered by Shah Jahan in 1654.
- While heads of other Rajput principalities were given high mansabs. Rana of Mewar was kept out of it.
- Dispute in Marwar was seen as opportunity to reasser importance of Mewar. Rani Hadi was sister of Rana's wife.
- Rana Raj Singh made preparation for war by fortifying the Chitoor fort, closing the Debari pass leading to capital Udaipur from North.
- A struck first blow in 1678, Rana retreated to the hills to conduct a guerilla warfare seeing this Aurangzeb retired to Ajmer.
- Mughals were at a terrain and local disadvantage and war was going towards a stalemate. Indra Singh and Ajit Singh both then renewed his claims to Marwar.
- Later after the death of Rana Raj Singh in 1680 the new Rana Jai Singh became lukewarm in Ajit SIngh's cause. There was also dissention b/w the Rathor and Sishodia Rajputs.
- Prince Akbar also rebelled during this time 1681.
- These development suggest that A Rajput policy had caused a widespread concern.
- Ajit SIngh in 1698 agreed to let Jodhpur remain in Mughal possession and was recognised as ruler of Marwar.
- Rana of Mewar was restored of his demanded Parganas in lieu of annual jizyah. Prince Azam secrectly colluded for Ranas support during war of succession.

#### Other Rajput States and Conclusion

- Rulers of Amber, Bikaner, Harauti continued to serve the Mughals and to receive imperial mansabs.
- Akbars policy of alliance with Rajputs was abandoned for alliance with influential local ruling elements including zamindars.
- After death of Jai Singh they still continued to be regarded as sword arms of the empire.

> Jadunath Sarkar says that loss caused due to his Rajput policy cannot be measured solely by men and money.

- His exclusion policy caused increased lawlessness, loss of prestige and casted doubt on political sagacity of Aurangzeb.
