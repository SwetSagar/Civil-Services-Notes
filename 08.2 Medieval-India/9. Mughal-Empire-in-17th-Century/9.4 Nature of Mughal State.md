## Akbars Concept of Suzerainty/ Nature of Mughal State

![[6.5 Mughal Empire First Phase Babur and Humayun#Turko-Mughal theory of Sovereignty What was it How did it originate and Develop]]

- His religious ideas and concept of suzerainty has been put forward by Abul Fazl.
- For him as per Abul F royalty was a divine right which was based on pre Islamic Sassanian/Iranian concept of royalty.
- He combined this concept with Muslim and Hindu thinking like paternal love towards subject, courage and firmness, trust in god etc.
- His views of Akbars suzerainty reeks of his own bias. A/C to him ignoble or lower classes should not aspire for a share in state power.

```ad-important

**Abul Fazl** tried to portray the ==concept of state and sovereignty== in terms of old Iranian traditions. A secularist poly-religious state based on composite ruling class, hierarchical in nature but open ended to a fair extent. Humane in dealing w/ masses, equal justice for all irrespective of birth, religion or status. 

```

- AF said that the distinction of dar-ul-Islam and dar-ul-harb had ceased to exist -> was put as justification for removal of Jizya.
- Per him Akbars conquest was not based on aggrandisement but to establish an all India polity based on justice and tolerance.

## Central and Provincial Structure of Govt

- Ak inherited the structure that was based on experience of the Delhi Sultanat.
- His system had some novel features functions and responsibilities were divided such that they did not encroach on each other but balanced one another ie a ==system of check and balances==.
- He dev system of provincial govt based on central system of govt. Detailed rules and regulations were devised to control administration. New regulations under name Dastur-ul-Amal or Rule books -> led to formation of bureaucratic sys.

### The Ruler

### Vakil

- Supervised all branches of govt. Babur's wazir was Nizamuddin Khwaja; Humayun's was Amir Wais and Hindu Beg. They all were primarily military men.
- Under Bairam K it became all too powerful so Ak took steps to avoid such situations. Ex drastic punishments to Adham Khan despite Maham Anga being Vakil.
- After Munim K was appt Jaunpu's governor no Vakil was appt for 7 years.
- In 1575 Muzaffar K was appt Vakil combining post of Vakil and Diwan assisted by Todar Nal and Shah Mansur.
- It remained empty for 10 yrs after him.

```

## Nur Jahan and the Nur Jaha 'Junta'

- [x] #todo
- Mehrunnisa married Jahangir in 1611 was the daughter of Itimad ud Dala/ Ghiyas Beg. He was taken into service under Akbar at Fatehpur Sikri and rose to the position of Diwan in 1595.
- Controversy has been about role of Nur Jahan and her impact on court politics during the last 16 yrs of J reign.
- $ Mutammad Khan a contemporary writer wrote that all important affairs of the empire passed into the hands of Jahangir.
	- He further states that not a single relation, slaves, proteges who was not granted a satisfactory mansab and jagir.
- Itimad ud Daula was raised to position of Wizarat and within a year his rank inc from 1500 to 4000. Her brother Asaf Khan continued to hold the post of Mir Bakshi.

```ad-Views
**Beni Prasad** put forward the theory that a 'junta' of the 3 and prince Khurram became dominant in the scene till 1620. 
- Hungry for power she decided to supersed him by a more reliant instrument his brother Shahriyar, whose marriage was arranged to Nur Jahan's daughter from first husband Sher Afghan.

```

- This led to the rise of a rival party whose candidate to the thone was Khusrau.

```ad-Views
**Nurul Hasan**  argued that promotions were well spread out 
```

 - There were other nobles like Mahabat Khan who continued to enjoy Jahangirs favor despite not enjoying support from the Junta.
 - There is also no contemporary evidence of a factional alliance b/w Nur Jahan and Khurram.
	 - Also the question of support for Shahriyar would not arise since by 1618 Shah Jahan was already having rank of 30, 000 zat and sowar and was given special position beside the throne in the darbar.
 - But Nur Jahan completely dominated the Haram. As far as her interference in political life is concerned. She sometimes sat in the Jharokha window, dictated orders to officers and received important messages.
 - Farmans were sometimes issued in her name. Coins have also been stuck in her name in dam, dirham and even on a silver rupee with the title 'Badshah Begum'.
 - She became a channel for seeking royal favours.
 - After 1622-27 when Jahangirs health began to fail she started participating more into the political affairs, since powerful noble like Mahabat Khan wanted to make the emperor their puppet.
 - It has been suggested that Persian nobles rose in prominence during her time. But not all of these nobles sided with Nur Jahan.

## Dara Shikoh

## Foreign Policy of the Mughals

- [x] #todo
- Uzbeks, Safavids and Ottomons were all powerful empires and thus there was a definite pattern of diplomatic and political relations.
- Diplomatic mode means exchange of missions or embassies. High level/ extraordinary ambassadors were nobles or related to royal families.
- Often carried a letter detailing achievements and conquests. Also had gifts and rarities.
- Missions had no fixed time.
- Their foreign policy was Indo centric and concerned with India's safety and security.
- Uzbeks and Safavids clashed for Khorasan and Transoxiana. Ottomans were Sunnis who were annoyed by Safavids who were constantly sending preachers to convert the Turks to shiaism.

### Akbar and the Uzbeks

- Abdullah Khan Uzbek had captured Balkh that acted as buffer between the Mughals and the Uzbeks. After which he sent an embassy to Akbar urging him to lead an expedition from India to Iran and divide the kingdom that was in disarray after the death of Shah Tahmasp.
- Akbar was not moved since he wanted a strong Iran to check the Uzbeks.
- He gave refuge to Timurid prince Mirza Suleiman who had been ousted from Badakshan.
- Abdullah Khan Uzber had fomented trouble in North West through Jalala, a religious fanatic. Akbar moved to Attock against this operation and also lost his friend Birbal.
- After Shah Tahmasps death 1576 Ottomons captured Norther Iran. Akbar sent and Embassy to Iran disapproving of this and offering armed support.
- Akbar also came in terms with the Abdullah chiefs to define a scientific frontein where the Mughals gave up their interest in Badakshan and Balkh which had been ruled by Timuridprinces and the Uzbeks not claiming Kabul and Qandahar.
- Akbar then occupied Qandahar in 1595.

### Qandahar Question and Iran

- Rising Uzbek power was the reason Safavids and Mughals came together. Qandahar was the only trouble between the 2.
- It had strategic and economic significance that made both of them claim it. Strategically it was vital for the defence of Kabul. Economically it was the hub of trade b/w India and Central Asia.
- It was more important to the Mughals as for Persians it was merely an outpost but for Mughals it was an important bastion for defence of their entire empire.
- In 1522 it came under control of Babur and no objection was raised. But in lieu of helping Humayun when he came to Shah Tahmasps help he agreed to help provided he transferred Qandahar to Iran. Which he did not but Shah took control of it after Humayun's death.
- After the Shah died and Abdullah Uzbek conquered Balkh. Akbar then conquered Qandahar to estd a defensive line in north west against possible Uzbek invasion.
- Shah Abbas tried to capture Qandahar after Akbars death but moved away after arrival of Mughal reinforcements.
- After Jahangir came to throne Abbas sent lavish gifts to him that was later returned by Jahangir.
- Many Indian traders settled in areas of Yezd, Shiraz, Isafahan, Tehran and Gilan including Hindus.
- Safavids took interest in Mughal deccan but it was limited.
- Persians attacked Qandahar in 1622 and captured it. Shah Abbas tried to play it down but the damage on the relationship was already done.
- This led to Mughals getting closer to Uzbeks. The Uzbeks kept the Persian Shah informed about the intrigues of the Mughals.
- Shah Jahan put up a common plan to attack Persia from 3 sides with the help of Uzbeks but they denied it.
- The Persians befriended the Ottomans to attack Qandahar but the Shah died on the way.

### Shah Jahans Balkh Campaign 1646

- In 1646 is considered a high watermark in Mughal foreign policy but its failure is also sometimes said to be the beginning of Mughal military decline.
- After death of Abdullah Khan Uzbek. Imam Quli became the rules and assigned Balk and bactria to his younger brother Nazr Muhammad.
- Nur Jahan and Imam Quli's mother exchanged embassies during this time.
- Nazr Muhammad attacked Kabul but was defeated. Imam Quli sent a friendhsip offering. Vice versa happened when Shah Jahan attacked occupied Bamiyan.
- Frequent sharing of embassy took place since 1633.
- Nazr Muhammad asked for Mughal help when his son joined the rebels. Prince Murad was sent to help but instead he had to occupy Balkh.
- A counter attack from Uzbeks was routed by the Mughal forces. Who had to then retreat due to the hostile population and approaching winter of 1647.
- The contemporary historians have stressed that Uzbek population wanted protection from raiding tribes who were tyrants and sinners.

> Riazul Islam has accused Shah Jahan of being an adventurist inspired by restoration of Timurid power.

- SJ wanted to protect the Kabul Kandahar line from united powerful Uzbek Khanate.
- It was not a failure since it ensure the safety of Kabul until the rise of Nadir Shah.

### Mughal Persian Relations Last Phase

- Aurangzeb made repeated attempts to capture Qandahar from the Persians but failed. Darah failed at it too.
- Diplomatic relations resumed after the failure to capture Qandahar. But Shah Abbas II was of unstable character and threatened invasion after disparaging Mughal ambassador.

### Conclusion

- Mughals succeeded in maintaining a scientific fronteir in north west. Their basic foreign policy was based on the defence of India buttressed by diplomatic means.
- It gave India security from foreing invasions till the disintegration of Mughal empire.
- They insisted on relations of equality with the Asian nations.
- Used foreign policy to promote India's commercial interest. Kabul and Qandahar were twin gateways. Indian traders settled all over Central Asia due to this.
