## Rajput Policy/ Relations with Rajputs

- Satish Chandra has divided Ak evolution of Rajput policy into 3 main phases.

### 1st Phase till 1572

- Rajput rajas who submitted considered loyal allies and were expected to give military service around their principalities but not outside.
- Ex. Man Singh did not take part in siege of Chittor, Bharmal and Bhagwant man were constant companion of Ak during Uzbek rebellion.

### 2nd Phase from Gujarat Campaign in 1572.

- Man Singh was appointed to lead campaign outside.
- Ak showed favour to the Kachhawahas . Rajputs of Ranthambore, Shekhawati Rajputs and Rajputs of Jodhpur played an imp role in this.
- Rajputs began to emerge as loyal sword-arm of the empire.
- in 1576 Man Singh was appointed to lead against Rana Pratap.

### The 3rd Phase Was from 1578

- Man Singh and Bhagwant Das came to Punjab for campaign againt NW and Kashmir. This was the time when Akbar broke w/ orthodx clergy.
- Badayuni called it a case of 'Hindu Wielding the sword of Islam'.
- Rajputs emerged as parnters in the Kingdom and as counter to Turani nobles whom Ak could not trust due to his break w/ Ulama.
- Adminsitrative duties were given to Baghwant Das. He was also asked to assist gov of Punjab -> rebellion in East joined by Clergy who proclaimed Mirza Hakim their ruler.
- Rajputs were asked to fight against Mirza Hakim, Akbars half brother. He was ousted from Lahore and reinstated at Kabul.
- Bhagwant Singh and Saeed Khan were appt joint governor of Lahore. Saeed was later transferred to Delhi.
- Alliance was strengthened further through marriages. Later in the reign Rajput were given adminstrative duties, Man Singh was appointed governor of Bihar and Bengal.
- Rajputs were appt as joint governors of 4 subah Lahore, Kabul, Agra, Ajmer as well as faujdars and commanders of forts.
- It was a mutually beneficial alliance. Rajputs raised their prestige, was financially rewarding.
- Princess of Jodhpur, Bikaner and Jaiselmer were married to Salim.
 - R were given broad autonomy over their own principalities.

### Relations w/ Mewar

- Ak sent diplomatic missions to Mewar all of which failed since Rana refused his personal submission -> A could have used a more flexible policy.
- This was done after his conquest of Bihar and Bengal, estd a new adm machinery, and after defeating Chandrasen of Marwar.
- 1576 Ak moved to Ajmer against Rana Pratap and deputed Man Singh to lead a campaign against him.
- Rana Pratap used the scorched earth policy devastating entire region upto Chitthor. Rana also befriended Bhils.
- Bo Haldighati was fought in Feb 1576. Rana had the upper hand during the initial attack but a rumour of Ak arrival and arrival of Mughal reserves pushed Rana to retreat.
- It was a struggle for local independence not H-M struggle, or of Rajput independence.
- Ak then personally led campaign against Rana. He persuaded local rulers to join his campaign.
- Rebellion in Bengal, Bihar forced Ak to withdraw. Later he moved to Lahore to look into NW situation
- No expeditions againt Rana was carried who recovered some of his terrirotries except Chittor. He died in 1597.
- Mewar submitted during the Reign of Jahangir.

## Certain other Features that Strengthened This Alliance Was
