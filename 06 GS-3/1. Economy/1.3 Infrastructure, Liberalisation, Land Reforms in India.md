    - 40% of capital is paid upfront while remaining 60% of the cost is paid over the life of the project as annuities
    - In BOT model if there is a low realisation of tariffs the contract would still be terminated and lead to loss for the concessionaire, it also led to building of NPAs, risks were unevenly distributed among Public and Private parties.
- Toll Operate Transfer (TOT) :
    - Toll highways operated by NHAI for more than 2 years
    - Auctioned to private player whoever bids the highest to operate(collect toll) and maintenance
    - Highways are bundled out and given to offset the risks
- Swiss Challenge :
    - A third party is asked to match the previous proposal, expert committee decides on which is the best proposal
    - Advantages :
        - Efficient use of capital, speeds up process
        - Good citizen services, transparency
        - Genuine competition, cost saving for gov
    - Disadvantages :
        - Politics-business nexus does not let real competition
        - Chances of large scale corruption
    - Kelkar committee discouraged it
- Viability Gap Funding : one time grant is given for projects that have economic viability but financial support is missing. Ex UDAN
- Take out Financing : loan on a property will be paid back over a long period which replaces a short term loan .
    - Done to address Asset-Liability mismatch
    - Expand sources of finance for infra projects
- Plug and Play model
    - Companies can start implementing projects immediately without worrying about all regulatory clearances
    - Done for big projects
    - Help attract foreign and domestic investment
- Infrastructure debt fund IDF:
    - Have long payback periods are capital intensive
    - Financed by NBFCs, present bond market lacks depth which limits its effectiveness
    - IDF can be structured either as a trust would be managed by SEBI or as a company managed by RBI
- Infra Investment Trust InvITs - similar to MF, enables direct investment, regulated by SEBI, used by NHAI , risks are contained, tax savings, ^e8y6u9
- Design-Build/ Engineering, Procurement, Construction EPC/ Turnkey :
    - Contractor designs and builds the facility for an upfront payment of fees.
- Lease
    - Operator is responsible for operating and maintaining infra facility but not required to make any large investment
    - Used with other models like BOT, Gov bears the investment risk
- Suitability and Selection of Model
    - PPPs can be complex
    - Creation of a SPV Special Purpose Vehicle is a key feature - it is a legal entity that undertakes a project and negotiates contract agreements with other parties
        - Their funds cannot be diverted
        - Helps bring together of other investors, sharing risks
- PPP in ports has been encouraged, FDI is 100% automatic route
- To attract investment/PPP in social sector reimbursement of service cost will help reduce time and cost over-runs, inc efficiency, improve quality
- PPP in education - 20 IITs were to be established in this model
    - Criticismprivatisation of education and dilution of the role of the govt
- PPP in Health Care Services -
    - National Health Policy 2017 advocates PPP
    - Proposed for treating non communicable diseases NCDs
    - Pros
        - Check rampant absenteeism
        - inc gov expenditure has failed to give results
        - Unable to attract and retain talent
        - High growth rate of private sector
    - Cons
        - Risk is unequally spread towards gov
        - Implementation is a challenge
        - Conflict of interest b/w Gov run centres and private
- PPP in Skill Development
    - PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana, Apprentice promotion scheme uses this model
- PPP in Digital India - ex Bharat Net project
- In Swacch Bharat Abhiyan - in social sector PPP model allows local citizens to become direct stakeholders
