Nationalisation of banks in 1969 14 private banks, six in 1980.

## Why?

- Large share of noninstitutional sources eg landlords,
- traders and moneylenders failed to meet the credit needs of the rural areas;

## Policy after 1969

- new branch licensing policy -> branches had to be opened in unbanked rural areas
- priority-sector lending was introduced : whereby 40% set aside credit for agriculture, MSME, housing etc,
- differential interest rate scheme for the weakest sections,
- Lead Bank scheme : a district was assigned to one bank
- RRBs estd in 1975 to enlarge the supply of institutional credit
- (NABARD) in 1982 to regulate cooperative banks and RRBs

## Outcomes:

- outstanding debt of rural households increased
- growth of financial intermediation, bank deposits, gross savings rate rose, gross investment rate rose,
- demonstrated the utility of monetary policy in furthering redistributionist goals

## Post 1991 Narasimham Committee :

- monetary policy should be divorced from redistributionist goals.
- banks should be free to practise commercial modes viz profitability as the primary goal, open and close branches as they desired
- Priority sector guidelines were diluted, rate regulations were removed

### Impacts:

- branches closed
- growth of agricultural credit fell
- total outstanding debt of rural households fell post;
- 2004 policy to double the flow of agricultural credit within three years
- new branch authorisation policy,
- Permission if RBI was satisfied that bank would serve underbanked areas
- By 2011 mandated that at least 25% of new branches located in unbanked centres

### Challenges:

- encouraged public banks to lend more for retail and personal loans,
- high-risk sectors banks funded by short-term deposit liabilities were taking on exposures that involved long-term risks
- rising non-performing assets
- fear of fiscal deficits
