# Static : Diff Types of Irrigation and Irrigation Systems Storage

2020-10-22 07:57:28

---

- Irrigation is artificial application of water, assist growth
- Well and Tube Well I -
    - In UP, Bihar, TN ex shallow wells, deep wells, tube wells, artesian
    - Advantages - cheap, easy to use, independent source, add fertility to soil
    - Demerits - limited areas can be irrigated, depletes ground water, not enough capacity
- Canal Irrigation
    - In areas of low level relief, deep fertile soils, perennial, extensive command areas in UP, PUN, HAR
    - Inundation C - water mainly in rainy season vs Perennial
    - Merits : perennial, saves crops from droughts
    - Demerits : overflow during rainy, suitable for plains only
- Tank - Ktaka, MP, Maha, Odisha, Kerala
    - Merits : natural, not costly, longer life span, fishing etc also carried
    - Demerits : drying up, lifting water and carrying to field requires cost
- Drip : use drippers, low level, most efficient, practiced on large crops
    - M : Fertilizer, Nutrient loss is min, field levelling not necessary, reduced leaching, recycled non potable water can be used, water application efficiency increases, soil erosion, weed growth negligible
    - D : initial cost can be more, clogging, time, harvest, loss if not installed properly
- Sprinkler : sprayed in air, suitable for uneven land, shallow soils
    - M : suitable for all types of soil, water saving, inc yield, saves land
    - D : Higher initial cost, efficiency dec in high wind high temp
- Furrow - trenches are dug, difficulty is ensuring uniform dispersion, water loss
- Surge Irrigation type of furrow, Ditch Irrigation
- Sub Irrigation - water delivered from below soil, absorbed upwards
    - M : water and nutrient conservation, labour saving
    - D : outfitting cost is relatively high, inc presence of disease in recycle water

# Static : Transport and Marketing of Agri Produce and Issues and Related Constraints

2020-10-22 07:57:58

---

- Transport - delivering product from farmers to final consumers, includes pre post harvesting, assembling, grading, storage, transportation and distribution
- Role - transmit macroeconomic signals, balance demand/ supply, providing incentives to producers to inc production and output, promote efficient use
- Regulatory measures

## APMC Act

- Mandates sale/purchase in specified markets
- Prices determined by open auction, conducted in transparent manner
- Market charges can be made from sale proceeds
- Farmers - APMC Mandis - Auctioning of produce to establish price - produce sold - commission agent charge
- Adv - removes malpractices, transparent, ensures fair deal
- D : encourage private trade, prevents private investment, act has reduced competition

### Model APMC Act 2003

- Private and cooperatives can set up licensed markets
- Provides for contract farming, provides for contract farming, direct marketing by private players

Problems facing agri marketing sys -

- Too many intermediaries, inadequate infra, private sector unwilling to invest, non-transparent price setting mechanism, ill equipped untrained staff, market info not easily accessible
- ECA
- Agri produce Grading Marketing Act
    - Defines standards of quality, prescribes grade specification for no of products
    - Authorises agri marketing advisor in each state
- Private and Coop sector in Marketing agri produce
    - Removal of licensing requirements on buying, stocking, transporting in Agri products, Milk and Milk product order
    - Safal - fruits, vegetables auction market, eliminates middle men
    - Mother Dairy food procuring, ITC E-choupal
- Initiatives to promote link b/w producers and consumers - Shetkari bazaars, Apni Mandis, Rythu Bazaars, Krushak Bazaars, Uzhavar Sandhais
- Farmer Producer Orgs - informal farmer groups, marketing coops, producer coys
- Organised Retail Outlets

# Static - E-technology in the Aid of Farmers

2020-10-22 07:51:37

---

- Computerised farm machinery, ITC e-Choupal, Kisan Kerala, Aaqua, Rice Knowledge management portal, E-Krishi, Mahindra Kisan Mitra, IFFCO, Agri Portal, Village Knowledge Centre VKCs
- ICT divided into 3 categories - those which aim at empowerment, enablement and Market expansion
- Helps farmers have better access to information, in soil management, water, seed, Fertiliser, Pest, Harvest, Post-Harvest
- Uses Remote sensing, computer simulation, assessment of speed and direction, soil quality assays, Crop yield predictions, Marketing
- Recent initiatives
    - e-NAM to integrate agri market online, view all info, commodity arrivals and prices
    - IFFO iMandi - social commerce app, for large communities
    - Export Inspection Council EIC promote ease of agri exports
    - Meghdoot app, Kisan Suvidha, Pusa Krishi app
- Importance - remedies water crisis, desertification, crop pests; develops efficient methods of advancement; make better informed decisions
- Challenges - lack of infra, right input and advisory, poor reach, Illiteracy, adoption issues/affordability,
- Need - outreach, monitoring, behavioural reforms, digital literacy
- Precision agri - use of satellite farming mgt concept, use ICT to manage crop health
- AI - simulates human intelligence, Learning, Reasoning, Self-correction
- Block Chain
- Food Systems are activities that involve producing, processing, transporting and consuming foods ^cb312c
