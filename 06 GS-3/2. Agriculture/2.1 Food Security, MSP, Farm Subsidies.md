# Static : Issues Relating to Direct and Indirect Farm Subsidies and MSP

2020-10-22 07:52:39

---

## Subsidy

- Subsidy = Price paid by farmers for key inputs - Actual retail market price
- It is of 2 types Direct farm subsidies and Indirect farm subsidies. Direct ones are being paid to make their product more competitive in the global market.
- Indirect are given in form of cheaper credit facilities, farm loan waivers, reduction in irrigation and electricity bills etc. India spends 2% of GDP on it, Fertiliser accounts for 2/3rd of it.
- 2 ways it is done is by providing MSP like remunerative prices, other is supplying input at lower cost ex electricity, irrigation water, credit, fertiliser
- Positive Impact
	- stimulate dev, promote risk taking,
	- encourage to use new inputs/ advance tech,
	- keep farmers at par w/ non farming communities,
	- providing food and nutritional security, inc access to poor farmers
- Negative Impact - fiscal imbalance, wastage of resources, creates trade distortions, leads to environmental degradation, benefits mostly rich farmers, inc in stockpile of grains, changes consumption pattern

### Types of Subsidies

- Fertiliser - by C gov, make fertilizer available to farmers, ensure fair returns on investment, Retention price scheme, Retention price - Maximum Selling price = Fertiliser Subsidy, Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme, Neem Coated Urea Policy, New Urea Policy
- Irrigation/ Wateron usage of ground water, by providing canals, dams, low/no prices for their use
- Seeds - distributing seeds at lower price
- Power - to draw groundwater, to private parties, diff b/w price paid by farmers for usage of electricity and actual cost of generating electricity
- Infra - roads, storage, power, info, transport
- Credit - diff b/w interest charged from farmers and actual cost of providing credit

## MSP

![[Pasted image 20220421131919.png]]

- guaranteed min floor price, support farmer from excess fall in prices, distress sales, on 7 cereals, 5 pulses, 8 oilseeds, Cash crops like raw cotton, Copra, Raw Jute, Virginia flu
- Done to incentivise farmers to adopt HYV, combat food scarcity, price fluctuations
- CACP decides prices on factors like
	- Cost of production
	- Input price
	- Market price
	- Demand Supply
	- Cost of Living
	- price level/inflation in India
	- internationals prices and domestic prices
	- area under crop
	- Yield, productivity
	- Issue price
	- Subsidies impact
	- Inter crop price parity
	- terms of trade b/w agriculture and non agriculture
	- min 50% as margin over cost of production
	- Implication of MSP on consumers of that product.
- MSP is at least 1.5 times the cost of production incurred by the farmers. It is fixed twice a year on recom of CACP.
- A2 + FL and C2 costs are considered.
	- A2 covers all paid out expense in cash and kind incurred by farmers on seeds, fertilisers, chemicals, hired labour, fuel and irrigation etc.
	- FL includes value of unpaid family Labour
	- C2 costs account for rentals and interest paid on owned land and fixed capital assets.

**Advantages**

- IN emerged grain surplus country
- food security achieved at National Level
- Inc in productoin of grains
- food prices remained stable
- inc in farm income
- economic transformation in well irrigated areas

**Drawbacks**

- biased towards Wheat
- Rice; change in consumption pattern
- more production of Wheat Rice Diversion of resources from crops like pulses, oilseeds etc
- inc in public stockholding etc

**Present scenario/Issues**

- no mechanism on ground to ensure farmers are paid MSP
- implementation of CACP prices
- change in criteria for calculating prices
- should include demand side factors
- distorted MSP - inefficiency in system

**Other issues**

- fixing MSP for political reasons
- low level of MSP causes agrarian crisis and farmer distress
- lack of viability in agri, small land holding size, low productivity,
- inc production cost, shrinking employment, declining growth rate

**Solutions**

- Land reforms, Access to irrigation, inc productivity,
- insurance coverage, public investment in agri, education and skill dev,
- promotion of rural non-farm sector,
- setting up of village labour intensive industries,
- providing institutional credit

**Alternative**

- Deficiency payment scheme ex PDPS,
- ensure no resale of product takes place

**Recom of Swaminathan** #committee

- changes in irrigation, productivity, credit, insurance,
- food security, bio resources, public investment in agri
- human dev, rural no farm
