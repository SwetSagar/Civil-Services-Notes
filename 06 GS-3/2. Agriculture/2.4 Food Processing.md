- Importance - link b/w agri and industries, absorbs major share of workers from agri, prevents wastage, processed food requires less space/storage, can be exported
- Adv - Resource advantage, increasing employment, curbing migration, curb food inflation, crop diversification, demand potential, driver of growth
- **Upstream stage** - involves searching and extracting RM
    - Requirements - Accessibility to RM, Modern extraction, good linkages w/ farmers, Storage facilities , quality testing facilities, transport facilities, work force
- **Downstream** - processing of materials collected
    - Requirements - latest processing techniques, processing machinery, quality testing facility, Org retail stores, Work force

**Answers and Analysis**

1. Elaborate the scope and significance of the food processing industry in India. (भारत में खाद्य प्सं स्रण उद्योग के काय्भक्त्र और महत्व का स े नवस्तार वण्भन कीजजए।) 2022

```ad-Answer

The food processing industry in India is one of the most important sectors of the economy, contributing significantly to the country's GDP. It is estimated that the food processing sector accounts for around 13% of India's manufacturing GDP and 8% of the total GDP. The sector is also the second largest employer after agriculture and provides employment to millions of people.

The food processing industry in India plays an important role in improving the nutritional value of food, increasing its shelf life, and making it more accessible to consumers. It also helps to reduce wastage of food by preserving it in the form of processed foods. The industry also helps to reduce the dependence on imports and increase the availability of domestic food products.

The government of India has taken various initiatives to promote the growth of the food processing industry in the country. These include the setting up of the National Mission on Food Processing, the setting up of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, and the introduction of various schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana. These initiatives have helped to create a conducive environment for the growth of the food processing industry in India.

Upstream Process: Upstream processes are activities that occur before the product or service reaches the customer. Examples of upstream processes include product design, research, marketing, and advertising.

Downstream Process: Downstream processes are activities that occur after the product or service reaches the customer. Examples of downstream processes include customer service, customer feedback, product returns, warranty services, and customer loyalty programs.

Upstream Process Bottlenecks: 
• Inadequate storage facilities and post-harvest management
• Lack of access to credit and capital
• Poor quality of inputs and infrastructure 
• Low levels of technology and mechanization
• Low levels of market information and market access
• Poor quality of extension services

Downstream Process Bottlenecks: 
• Poor infrastructure for post sales services, examples return support etc.
• Lack of access to formal markets
• Limited capacity of farmers to participate in value chain activities.
• Low levels of processing and packaging.
• Limited access to market information.
• Unorganized nature of markets and lack of regulation.
