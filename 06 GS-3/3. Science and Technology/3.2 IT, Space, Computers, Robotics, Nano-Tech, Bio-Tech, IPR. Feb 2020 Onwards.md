IN data localisation norm : process data (legislative purpose, issue licenses, prevent law order breakdown, if mandated by other laws) Help : law order, socio-economic growth, boost start up
Srikrishna #committee :	cannot depend US other, sea optic network breakdown.
Recom :
	- at least 1 copy stored IN,
	- prevent foreign survey IN data.
	- Per RBI data localisation for payment sys is mandatory.
	- Same views can be seen manifesting in Draft personal data protectn bill 2018 & e commerce policy : cross border sharing.

Challenges:
overlook negative aspect of localization, short sighted, might not help e-com growth, may spur retaliatory measure, rise in price of foreign cloud services impact MSMEs, detrimental global economy, infra IN insufficient
Need: integrated long term strat, create opportunity local data centres, regulatory + legislative framework, Infra investment, attention IT BPO sector.
CA,AU,CN,VN w IN, BR JA SKR NZ making laws, US EU say hamper free trade harmful coys bcz multiple compliance. Alter : Law agencies illegally use data, against Article 21(Puttaswami v Union IN) privacy right, citizen right uphold.

- Jellyfish stings anti venom made by Gene edition using CRISPR Cas9 called Cyclodextrin.
- Genes contain bio-information.
- CRISPR Cas9 (enzyme) : Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, makes gene editing faster simpler. Targeting specific DNA stretches, corrects gene defects, Cas9 protein removes the effected strand(Stretch), DNA automatically heals, Ethical concerns, no global protocol, scrutiny required
- China used cure HIV in embryos removing CCR5 gene but ethically CRISPR (clinically untested procedure) not used clinical embreyos, only against disease which have no treatment(HIV supressed by drugs), CCR5 helps in prevent lung infections/pneumonia, CN wants draft regulation against reproductive uses technique

### Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR)

AMR ex. Staphylococcus Aureus resistant to Methicillin, UN Ad Hoc group issues warning : increase in death upto 10 million by 2050 and increase in poverty, could lead to 2008 like financial crisis.
Caused by incessant use, counterfeit drugs, unclean water, inadequate sewage treatment. Treatment more riskier, costlier, time taking. India : poorly regulated pharma industry, phasing out critical human use antibiotics in animals, multi-stakeholder approach, distributing responsibly, development of new antibodies, improved hygiene, vaccination, wealthier nation help poor ones, strong regulatory mech, R&D.

- Most misused in dairy sector
