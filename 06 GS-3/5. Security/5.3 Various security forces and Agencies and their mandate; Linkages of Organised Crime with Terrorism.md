**Answers and Analysis**

1. Human rights activists constantly highlight the view that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) is a draconian act leading to cases of human rights abuses by the security forces.

• Section 4 of the AFSPA gives the armed forces sweeping powers to search any premises, arrest without warrant and even open fire if they feel that it is necessary for the maintenance of public order.

• Section 6 of the AFSPA states that no prosecution, suit or other legal proceedings shall be instituted, except with the previous sanction of the Central Government, against any person in respect of anything done or purported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred by the Act.

• Section 7 of the AFSPA states that no suit, prosecution or other legal proceedings shall lie against any person in respect of anything done or intended to be done in good faith under this Act.

• Section 8 of the AFSPA states that no court shall take cognizance of any offence alleged to have been committed by any member of the armed forces in the discharge of his duty except with the previous sanction of the Central Government.

• Section 9 of the AFSPA states that no proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted in any court against any person in respect of anything done or purported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred by this Act.

• Section 10 of the AFSPA states that no person accused of any offence shall be apprehended without a warrant.

• Section 11 of the AFSPA states that no person accused of any offence shall be detained in custody for a period exceeding 24 hours without the authority of a magistrate.

• Section 13 of the AFSPA states that no civil court shall have jurisdiction over any matter which the armed forces are empowered by the Act to determine.

• Section 14 of the AFSPA states that no person shall be prosecuted or punished for any act done or purported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred by the Act.

The Supreme Court of India has held that the AFSPA is a valid piece of legislation and is not violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The court has also held that the provisions of the Act are not arbitrary or oppressive and are in consonance with the principles of natural justice. The court has further held that the powers conferred on the armed forces are necessary for the maintenance of public order and the security of the State. The court has also held that the provisions of the Act are not intended to be used for the purpose of punishing innocent citizens and that the powers conferred on the armed forces should be used only in exceptional circumstances and with utmost caution. The court has also held that the provisions of the Act should be interpreted in a manner that ensures that human rights are not violated. [Naga People's Movement of Human Rights v. Union of India (1998) 2 SCC 109.]
