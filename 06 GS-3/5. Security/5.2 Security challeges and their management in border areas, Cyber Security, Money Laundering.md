1. What are the maritime security challenges in India? Discuss the organisational, technical and procedural initiatives taken to improve the maritime security. (भारत में समुद्री सुरक्ा चुनौनतयाँ क्ा हैं? समुद्री सुरक्ा में सुधार के ललए की गई सं गठनात्मक, तकनीकी और प्हरियात्मक पहलो की ं नववेचना कीजजए।) 2022

```ad-Answer

Maritime security in India is facing a number of challenges, including illegal activities such as piracy, smuggling, and illegal fishing. Other threats include terrorism, human trafficking, and environmental degradation.

Organizational Initiatives:

The Indian government has taken a number of organizational initiatives to improve maritime security. These include the establishment of the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) in 1978, the promulgation of the Maritime Zones of India Act in 1981, and the establishment of the National Maritime Authority (NMA) in 2004. The ICG is responsible for patrolling the Indian coast and enforcing maritime laws. The NMA is responsible for formulating and implementing maritime security policies.

Technical Initiatives:

The Indian government has also taken a number of technical initiatives to improve maritime security. These include the installation of Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders on all Indian flagged vessels, the implementation of the Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS), and the installation of Coastal Surveillance Radar Systems (CSRS). The AIS transponders help identify and track vessels, while the VTMS and CSRS help monitor and manage vessel traffic.

Procedural Initiatives:

The Indian government has also taken a number of procedural initiatives to improve maritime security. These include the introduction of the Indian Port Security Code (IPSC) in 2008, the establishment of the National Maritime Security Council (NMSC) in 2009, and the adoption of the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code in 2011. The IPSC provides guidelines for port security and the NMSC is responsible for formulating and implementing maritime security policies. The ISPS Code provides guidelines for the security of ships and port facilities.

1. How is S-400 air defence system technically superior to any other system presently available in the world? (S-400 हवाई रक्ा प्णाली, नवश् में इस समय उपलधि अन् हकसी प्णाली की तुलना में हकस प्कार से तकनीकी रूप से रिेटि है?)
2021

```ad-Answer

The S-400 air defence system is technically superior to any other system presently available in the world due to its advanced capabilities. It has a maximum range of 400 km, which is significantly greater than the range of other systems. It can detect and track up to 300 targets simultaneously and engage up to 36 targets at once. It is also able to engage targets at a much higher altitude than most other systems, allowing it to intercept ballistic missiles. Additionally, it can detect stealth aircraft and has an advanced electronic countermeasures system to counter jamming. Finally, the S-400 system is also much more mobile than other systems, making it easier to deploy in the field.

1. For effective border area management, discuss the steps required to be taken to deny local support to militants and also suggest ways to manage favourable perception among locals. (प्भावी सीमावती क् ं त्रे प्बनन हेतु हहसावा ं हदयो को स् ं ानीय समथि्भन से वंचचत करने के आवश्यक उपायो की ं नववेचना कीजजए और स्ानीय लोगो में ं
अनुकू ल धरना प्बंधन के तरीके भी सुजाइए।) 2020

```ad-Answer

Border area management is a complex task that requires a multi-pronged approach. It involves the management of both the physical and psychological aspects of the region, as well as the effective management of the local population. The most important objective of border area management is to deny local support to militants and to create a favourable perception among the locals.

The first step in denying local support to militants is to improve security in the region. This includes deploying more troops and police to the region, as well as increasing the presence of intelligence agencies. This will help to deter militants from entering the region and will also create a sense of security among the local population. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the security forces are well-trained and equipped to deal with any threats.

The second step is to improve the infrastructure in the region. This includes providing basic amenities such as water, electricity, and roads. This will ensure that the local population has access to basic necessities and will also create a sense of development in the region. Additionally, it is important to provide economic opportunities to the local population. This can be done by providing access to educational and employment opportunities, as well as providing incentives for businesses to set up in the region.

The third step is to engage with the local population. This can be done through a variety of ways, such as organising meetings with local leaders and organising events to promote local culture and traditions. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the local population is informed about any security measures that are being taken in the region. This will help to create a sense of trust between the security forces and the local population.

The fourth step is to create a favourable perception among the locals. This can be done by engaging with the local population in a positive manner and by creating a sense of ownership among the locals. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the security forces are not seen as an oppressive force, but rather as a force that is there to protect the local population.

Finally, it is important to ensure that the local population is aware of the consequences of supporting militants. This can be done through public awareness campaigns and by making sure that the local population is aware of the legal ramifications of supporting militants. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the local population is aware of the benefits of not supporting militants. This can be done through providing incentives for those who do not support militants and by providing information about the consequences of supporting them.
