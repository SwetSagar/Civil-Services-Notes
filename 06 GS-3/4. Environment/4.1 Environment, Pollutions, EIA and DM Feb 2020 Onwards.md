- 4th EY's RE attractive index say that IN get sunlight all yr,
- 175 RE capacity (100 solar + 60 wind + 10 biomass+ 5 small hydro) + 50 large hydro = 225GW, wind and solar energy suffer lack policy & implementation, 2019-20 cut solar target 23%
- India has one of the fastest growing Renewable Energy capacity in the world.
- COP-21 in Paris Agreement India said that it'll achieve 40% of power generation capacity from non fossil fuels.
- Target of 450 GW Renewable by 2030.

Prob :
