The war between Russia and Ukraine raises several ethical issues that need to be considered in order to understand the implications of the conflict. The following are some of the most crucial ethical issues that need to be addressed:

1.  The principle of non-aggression: This principle states that a country should not initiate an armed conflict against another country without a just cause. In the case of Russia and Ukraine, the question of whether Russia had a just cause to invade Ukraine and annex Crimea remains a subject of intense debate.
    
2.  The responsibility to protect civilians: As per international law, a country has an obligation to protect its citizens and prevent harm to them during times of conflict. In the current situation, both Russia and Ukraine have been accused of violating this obligation by targeting civilians and committing war crimes.
    
3.  The use of disproportionate force: The use of excessive force by either side raises ethical questions about the right to self-defense and the limits of military action. In this conflict, both sides have been accused of using disproportionate force, leading to the death of innocent civilians.
    
4.  The principle of self-determination: This principle states that individuals have the right to determine their own political future and choose their own form of government. In the case of Ukraine, the question of whether the people of Crimea have the right to self-determination and the right to secede from Ukraine remains unresolved.
    
5.  The principle of respect for sovereignty: This principle states that countries should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries. In the case of Russia and Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea by Russia raises questions about the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
    
6.  The obligation to comply with international law: Both Russia and Ukraine have obligations under international law to respect human rights and comply with international humanitarian law. In the current conflict, both sides have been accused of violating international law and human rights.
    
In conclusion, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine raises several crucial ethical issues that need to be addressed in order to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The issues of non-aggression, the responsibility to protect civilians, the use of disproportionate force, the principle of self-determination, the principle of respect for sovereignty and the obligation to comply with international law all need to be considered in order to arrive at a just and equitable solution.

1. “Refugees should not be turned back to the country where they would face prosecution or human rights violation.” Examine the statement with reference to the ethical dimension being violated by the nation claiming to be democratic with an open society. (“शरणार्थियो को उस दे ं श में वापस नही लौ ं टाया जाना चाहिए जहाँ उन्हें उत्पीड़न अथवा मानवाधिकारो के उल् ं लंघन का सामना करना पड़ेगा।" खुले समाज और लोकतांत्रिक होने का दावा करने वाले किसी राष्ट्र के द्वारा नैतिक आयाम के उल्लंघन के सं दर्भ में इस कथन का परीक्षण कीजिए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

The statement "Refugees should not be turned back to the country where they would face prosecution or human rights violation" highlights the importance of respecting human rights and upholding the principles of justice and fairness. The notion that refugees should not be sent back to countries where they would face prosecution or human rights violation is based on the fundamental ethical principle of non-refoulement. This principle is widely recognized in international law and is considered a cornerstone of the protection of refugees.

The duty of non-refoulement, which is the obligation of states not to expel or return refugees in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where their life or freedom would be threatened, is recognized in the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, as well as in several regional human rights instruments. The principle of non-refoulement is also considered a customary norm of international law, meaning that it is binding on all states regardless of whether they have ratified the 1951 Convention or not.

By sending refugees back to countries where they would face prosecution or human rights violation, democratic nations with an open society would be violating the principles of human dignity and respect for human life. This would also contravene the principles of equality and non-discrimination, as refugees are often targeted for their race, ethnicity, religion, political opinion, or other grounds. Moreover, turning back refugees would undermine the rule of law and the protection of human rights, as it would allow states to bypass their obligations under international law and engage in human rights abuses with impunity.

In addition, denying refugees protection and returning them to countries where they would face persecution or human rights violations would also contravene the principles of compassion and solidarity. By turning back refugees, democratic nations with open societies would be closing their doors to those who are most in need of protection and assistance. This would be a breach of the moral obligation to protect the vulnerable and to provide a safe and secure haven for those who are fleeing persecution and violence.

1. Discuss the role of ethics and values in enhancing the following three major components of Comprehensive National Power (CNP) viz. human capital, soft power (culture and policies), and social harmony. (व्यापक राष्ट्रीय शक्ति (सी.एन.पी.) के तीन मुख्य घटको जैसे मानवीय पूँजी, मृद ं ुशक्ति (सं स्कृति और नीतियां) तथा सामाजिक सद्भाव की अभिवृद्धि में नीति-शास्त्र और मूल्यों की भू ्यों मिका का विवेचन कीजिए।) 2020

```ad-Answer

Human Capital:
• Ethics and values play an important role in enhancing human capital. By providing a strong moral foundation for individuals, organizations, and societies, ethics and values can help to develop a highly skilled and educated workforce. For example, ethics and values can help to ensure that employees are treated fairly and with respect, which can lead to greater job satisfaction and a more productive workforce. Furthermore, ethical values can help to ensure that organizations are run in a responsible and efficient manner, leading to a more efficient use of resources and a greater return on investment.

Soft Power (Culture and Policies):
• Ethics and values can also help to enhance soft power (culture and policies). By promoting a culture of respect and inclusion, ethics and values can help to foster a more open and tolerant society, which can in turn lead to greater economic and social development. Furthermore, ethical values can help to ensure that policies are implemented in a responsible manner, taking into account the needs of all stakeholders and promoting the common good. For example, ethical values can help to ensure that policies are implemented in a way that is fair and equitable, promoting social justice and economic prosperity.

Social Harmony:
• Ethics and values can also help to enhance social harmony. By promoting a culture of mutual respect and understanding, ethics and values can help to foster a more peaceful and harmonious society. For example, ethical values can help to ensure that individuals and groups are treated fairly and with respect, which can lead to greater understanding and cooperation between different groups. Additionally, ethical values can help to ensure that policies are implemented in a way that respects the rights of all individuals and groups, promoting a sense of unity and social cohesion.

1. ‘The will to power exits, but it can be tamed and be guided by rationality and principles of moral duty.’ Examine this statement in the context of international relations. ('शक्ति की इच्छा विद्यमान है, लेकिन विवेकशीलता और नैतिक कर्त्तव्य के सिद्धांतो से उसे सा ं धित और निर्देशित किया जा सकता है।' अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सम्बन्धों के सं द ्धों र्भ में इस कथन का परीक्षण कीजिए।) 2020

```ad-Answer



The will to power is a concept that has been explored by numerous philosophers throughout history, particularly Friedrich Nietzsche. It is often associated with the pursuit of dominance, the desire to be superior to others, and the striving for control and authority. In the context of international relations, the will to power can manifest itself in a variety of ways, such as the use of military force or economic coercion to gain political influence.

However, although the will to power exists, it can be tempered and guided by rationality and principles of moral duty. In international relations, this can mean that states can use diplomatic solutions to resolve conflicts, rather than resorting to violence or coercion. States can also abide by international law, which provides a framework for the peaceful resolution of disputes and the protection of human rights. Additionally, states can work together to build mutually beneficial relationships, such as through trade agreements, alliances, and other forms of cooperation.

In this way, the will to power can be tamed and guided by rationality and principles of moral duty. This allows states to pursue their interests in a way that is consistent with the values and norms of the international community, and can help to create a more peaceful and prosperous global order.

1. Strength, peace and security are considered to be the pillars of international relations. Elucidate. (शक्ति, शांति एवं सुरक्षा अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सं बं धो के आधार माने जाते हैं । स्प ं ष्ट कीजिए।) 2017

```ad-Answer

Strength, peace, and security are considered to be the three pillars of international relations, reflecting the three fundamental goals that nations strive to achieve in their foreign policies. These pillars serve as the foundation for the interactions between nations and help ensure stability, cooperation, and prosperity in the international system.

Strength refers to the military, economic, and political power of a nation, and it serves as a key determinant of the country's ability to pursue its foreign policy objectives. A nation with strength can assert its interests on the international stage, deter potential aggressors, and defend itself against external threats. For example, the United States, with its strong military and economic power, has been able to project its power globally and shape the international system in its image. Similarly, China, with its growing economic strength, has been able to challenge the existing global order and advance its interests.

Peace refers to the absence of conflict and tensions between nations. It is the foundation for stability, cooperation, and mutual understanding among nations. The United Nations, with its charter to maintain peace and security, is an example of international efforts to promote peace and prevent conflict. International treaties and agreements, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, aim to reduce the risk of conflict and promote peace through disarmament and arms control measures. Additionally, conflict resolution mechanisms, such as diplomacy and international arbitration, help to resolve disputes between nations peacefully.

Security refers to the protection of a nation's territorial integrity and sovereignty, as well as the well-being of its citizens. A nation's security is dependent on its strength, as well as its ability to maintain stability and ensure peace. For example, NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a military alliance that aims to provide collective defense and promote stability and security in Europe and North America. Similarly, regional organizations, such as the African Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, play a role in promoting peace, stability, and security within their respective regions.

In conclusion, the three pillars of international relations—strength, peace, and security—are interdependent and critical to the maintenance of stability and cooperation in the international system. While each pillar has its own importance, they are all necessary to ensure the well-being and prosperity of nations and the world as a whole.

1. At the International level, the bilateral relations between most nations are governed on the policy of promoting one's own national interest without any regard for the interest of other nations. This leads to conflicts and tensions between the nations. How can ethical consideration help resolve such tensions? Discuss with specific examples. (अंतर्राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर, अधिकांश राष्ट्रों के बीच ष्ट्रों द्विपक्षीय सं बं ध, अन्य राष्ट्रों के ह ष्ट्रों ितो का सम् ं मान किए बिना स्वयं के राष्ट्रीय हित की प्रोन्नति करने की नीति के द्वारा नियंत्रित होते हैं। इससे राष्ट्रों के बीच द् ष्ट्रों वंद्व और तनाव उत्पन्न होते हैं। ऐसे तनावो के समाधान में नै ं तिक विचार किस प्रकार सहायक हो सकते हैं? विशिष्ट उदाहरणो के सा ं थ चर्चा कीजिए।) 2015

Ethical considerations can help resolve tensions between nations by promoting fairness, cooperation, and mutual respect. The following are some examples of how ethical considerations can play a role in resolving international tensions:

1.  Respect for sovereignty: The respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations is a fundamental ethical principle in international relations. By recognizing the sovereignty of other nations, countries can reduce tensions and promote peace. For example, if nations agree to respect each other's borders, then they can reduce the likelihood of conflict over territorial disputes.
    
2.  Fair trade practices: Fair trade practices are important in resolving tensions between nations. When nations engage in fair and transparent trade, they reduce the likelihood of conflict and promote economic growth. For example, if a nation agrees to follow international trade rules, such as those established by the World Trade Organization, then it can reduce tensions with other nations.
    
3.  Human rights: Respect for human rights is an important ethical consideration in resolving international tensions. When nations promote and protect the rights of their citizens, they can reduce the likelihood of conflict and promote peace. For example, if a nation agrees to respect the rights of minorities within its borders, then it can reduce tensions with other nations that have different ethnic groups.
    
4.  Environmental protection: Environmental protection is another important ethical consideration in resolving international tensions. When nations agree to work together to protect the environment, they can reduce the likelihood of conflict over scarce resources and promote sustainable development. For example, if nations agree to limit greenhouse gas emissions, then they can reduce the impact of climate change and promote peace.
    

In conclusion, ethical considerations play a critical role in resolving tensions between nations by promoting fairness, cooperation, and mutual respect. By considering these ethical principles in international relations, nations can reduce the likelihood of conflict and promote peace and stability.

Case Study: IR-Defends Export to Friendly Countries (2020)

The Chairman of Bharat Missiles Ltd (BML) was watching a program on TV wherein the Prime Minister was addressing the nation on the necessity of developing a self-reliant India. He subconsciously nodded in agreement and smiled to himself as he mentally reviewed BML’s journey in the past two decades. BML had admirably progressed from producing first-generation anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) to designing and producing state of the art ATGM weapon systems that would be the envy of any army. He sighed in reconciliation with his assumptions that the government would probably not alter the status quo of a ban on the export of military weaponry. To his surprise, the very next day he got a telephone call from the Director-General, Ministry of Defence, asking him to discuss the modalities of increasing BML production of ATGMs as there is a probability of exporting the same to a friendly country. The Director-General wanted the Chairman to discuss the details with his staff in Delhi next week. Two days later, at a press conference, the Defence Minister stated that he aims to double the current weapons export levels within five years. This would give an impetus to financing the development and manufacturing of indigenous weapons in the country. He also stated that all indigenous arms manufacturing nations have a very good record of the international arms trade. As the Chairman of BML, what are your views on the following points:

1. As an arms exporter of a responsible nation like India, what are the ethical issues involved in arms trade?
2. List five ethical factors that would influence the decision to sell arms to foreign governments.

```ad-Answer

1.  As an arms exporter of a responsible nation like India, there are several ethical issues involved in arms trade:

a. Responsibility for end-use: The arms exported by a country must not be used for unethical purposes such as human rights violations or acts of terrorism. As an exporter, it is important to ensure that the weapons are used in accordance with international law and human rights.

b. Human rights: The arms trade must not contribute to human rights violations or harm civilians. The exporter should ensure that the weapons will not be used to suppress political opposition, target civilians, or commit other human rights violations.

c. Transparency: The arms trade should be transparent and open, with appropriate measures in place to monitor the end-use of the weapons. This can help to prevent arms proliferation and ensure that the weapons are used for their intended purposes.

d. Responsibility for arms proliferation: The exporter should take steps to prevent the spread of weapons to regions of conflict or to countries that may use the weapons for unethical purposes.

e. Economic impact: The arms trade should not harm the local economy by reducing employment, undermining development or increasing poverty.

2.  Five ethical factors that would influence the decision to sell arms to foreign governments are:

a. Political stability: The exporter should consider the political stability of the receiving country and ensure that the weapons will not be used in a conflict that could destabilize the region.

b. Human rights record: The exporter should consider the human rights record of the receiving country and ensure that the weapons will not be used to violate human rights.

c. National security: The exporter should consider the impact of the arms trade on their own national security, including the potential for the weapons to fall into the hands of adversaries.

d. International law: The exporter should ensure that the arms trade complies with international law, including the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty.

e. Public opinion: The exporter should consider public opinion on the arms trade, including the views of civil society organizations and advocacy groups. Public opinion can influence the decision to sell arms, and it is important to engage in open and transparent discussions with stakeholders to ensure that the arms trade is consistent with ethical principles.
