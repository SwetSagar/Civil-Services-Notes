**Answers and Analysis**

1. Should impartial and being non-partisan be considered indispensable qualities to make a successful civil servant? Discuss with illustrations. (क्या सफल लोक सेवक बनने के लिए निष्पक्ष और गैर-पक्षपाती होना अनिवार्य गुण माना जाना चाहिए? दृष्टांत सहित चर्चा कीजिए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

Impartiality and being non-partisan are considered crucial qualities for a successful civil servant, as they ensure that the civil servant is able to perform their duties objectively and without any bias. The role of a civil servant is to serve the government and implement its policies and programs for the betterment of the society, without being influenced by personal or political interests.

Impartiality ensures that the civil servant is not biased towards a particular section of the society or community. For example, if a civil servant is tasked with the distribution of relief aid to flood-affected areas, they must ensure that the aid is distributed equally to all affected people, regardless of their caste, religion, or political affiliation.

Being non-partisan, on the other hand, requires the civil servant to maintain a neutral stance towards political parties and their ideologies. This quality is especially important in a democracy, where the government is elected through a political process. A civil servant must be able to work efficiently with whichever political party is in power, without being swayed by their political beliefs or affiliations.

Moreover, impartiality and non-partisanship enable civil servants to carry out their responsibilities in an ethical and transparent manner, thereby building the trust and confidence of the people they serve. The reputation of a civil servant can be significantly impacted if they are perceived as biased or partisan, as this can lead to a loss of public confidence in the government and its institutions.

1. Besides domain knowledge, a public official needs innovativeness and creativity of a high order as well, while resolving ethical dilemmas. Discuss with a suitable example. (नैतिक दविु धाओ का समाधान ं

```ad-Answer

Innovation and creativity are crucial traits for public officials, as they must find new and effective solutions to complex ethical dilemmas. In the public sector, ethical dilemmas can arise from conflicting values, scarce resources, conflicting loyalties, and competing demands. In such situations, a public official must balance competing interests and find a solution that is both effective and ethical.

An example of where innovativeness and creativity were needed in resolving an ethical dilemma is the introduction of a new policy on open defecation in India. The government recognized that the practice of open defecation was a major contributor to poor health and sanitation in rural areas. However, many rural residents were resistant to using toilets, either because they lacked the financial means to construct one, or because of cultural attitudes towards the use of toilets.

In response to this dilemma, the government introduced an innovative and creative solution, known as the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach. This approach involved mobilizing communities to take ownership of the problem of open defecation and find solutions that worked for them. CLTS involved training community members to conduct surveys and create "triggers" that would motivate people to build toilets and adopt better sanitation practices. These triggers could include information about the health risks associated with open defecation, the economic benefits of using toilets, or community-wide events designed to raise awareness.

The CLTS approach was effective in reducing open defecation and improving sanitation in rural areas, and it was recognized as a best practice by the United Nations. This example illustrates how innovation and creativity can be applied to ethical dilemmas in the public sector, and how they can lead to effective and ethical solutions.

1. “In looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence and energy. And if they do not have the first, the other two will kill you.”–Warren Buffett. What do you understand by this statement in the present-day scenario? Explain. ("नियुक्ति के लिए व्यक्तियो की खोज करते समय आप तीन गुणो को खोजते हैं : सत्यन ं िष्ठा, बुद्धिमत्ता और ऊर्जा । यदि उनमें पहला गुण नही है, तो अ ं न्य दो गुण आपको समाप्त कर देंगे ।”–बॉरेन बफेट वर्तमान परिदृश्य में इस कथन से आप क्या समझते हैं ? स्पष्ट कीजिए।) 2018

```ad-Answer

Warren Buffett's statement highlights the importance of integrity in an individual's character and how it is the foundation for effective and ethical behavior. In the present day scenario, this statement holds immense significance, especially in the context of public servants.

Integrity is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles. It refers to the consistency between an individual's actions, words, values, and beliefs. In a public servant, integrity is crucial as they are the ones who are responsible for making decisions that impact the lives of people. Hence, they need to be honest, transparent, and impartial while making decisions, as this will not only earn them the trust of the public but also ensure that the decision-making process is fair and unbiased.

In the absence of integrity, even the most intelligent and energetic public servants can cause harm to the public. For instance, if a public servant is not honest, he/she may make decisions that benefit their personal interests rather than the public's. This can lead to corruption and the abuse of power, which can have serious consequences for the public. Similarly, if a public servant lacks strong moral principles, they may be swayed by external pressures and make decisions that are unethical and harmful to the public.

To prevent non-ethical behavior in public servants, it is important to inculcate a strong ethical culture within the organization. This can be achieved through the following means:

1.  Code of Ethics: Establishing a code of ethics that lays down the standards of behavior expected of public servants can help them make ethical decisions.
    
2.  Ethical training: Providing ethical training to public servants can help them understand the importance of integrity and ethical behavior.
    
3.  Monitoring and accountability: Setting up mechanisms to monitor the behavior of public servants and hold them accountable for their actions can help ensure that they adhere to ethical standards.
    
4.  Encouraging reporting of unethical behavior: Creating an environment where public servants feel comfortable reporting unethical behavior can help identify and prevent such behavior.
    
5.  Lead by example: Public servants who are in positions of authority should lead by example and demonstrate the importance of integrity and ethical behavior.

```ad-Answer

The three basic values that are universal in nature in the context of civil services are integrity, impartiality and accountability. These values are essential for a public servant to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently in serving the public.

Integrity is considered the cornerstone of the civil service as it refers to the honesty, truthfulness, and ethical behavior of a public servant. A public servant with integrity can be trusted to carry out their duties with sincerity, impartiality, and in the best interest of the public. This helps to build trust and confidence in the public service, which is essential for maintaining the legitimacy of the government.

Impartiality is another crucial value in civil services as it ensures that public servants do not show bias or favoritism in carrying out their duties. Public servants are expected to serve all citizens equally and make decisions based on merit, rather than personal interests or biases. This helps to maintain the fairness and impartiality of the government and ensures that everyone has equal access to public services.

Accountability is the third key value in the civil service as it involves being responsible for one's actions and decisions. Public servants are expected to take responsibility for their actions and decisions, and to be transparent in their dealings with the public. This helps to ensure that public servants are held to a high standard of accountability, which in turn enhances the credibility and integrity of the civil service.

-   Courage of conviction is the ability of public officials to stand up for their beliefs and principles, even in the face of opposition or adversity.
-   This is particularly important in the civil service, as public officials are often required to make difficult and unpopular decisions.
-   Courage of conviction helps to ensure that decisions are made based on merit, rather than political pressure.

(e) Spirit of service:

-   The spirit of service is a selfless dedication to the public good.
-   In the context of civil service, it is the idea that public officials are there to serve the public, rather than themselves.
-   This helps to ensure that public officials are motivated to act in the best interests of the community, rather than for personal gain.

Integrity is a quality of being honest and having strong moral principles, and a test of integrity is the complete refusal to be compromised, which means that a person with integrity will stand firm in their principles and values even in the face of adversity or temptation.

Here is an example to illustrate this:

1.  Whistleblowing: In the corporate world, employees who expose unethical practices or corruption within their organization demonstrate their commitment to integrity by standing up for what is right, even if it means facing retaliation or putting their job at risk.
    
2.  Honest Reporting: In the public sector, civil servants are expected to report their actions truthfully and accurately, even if it means admitting to mistakes or going against the grain.
    
3.  Refusing Bribes: In many countries, bribes and corruption are a widespread issue, and a public servant who refuses to be compromised by these unethical practices demonstrates their integrity.
    
4.  Maintaining Confidentiality: Confidential information is often entrusted to public servants, and maintaining the confidentiality of this information requires integrity, as a public servant must be able to resist the temptation to use confidential information for personal gain or to further their own interests.

Trustworthiness and fortitude are important virtues that are crucial for the effective functioning of public service. These virtues are not only essential for building the credibility and legitimacy of the public service, but they are also critical for maintaining the public trust in the government and its institutions. Here are some of the ways in which these virtues get manifested in public service:

1.  Honesty and transparency: Trustworthiness in public service is demonstrated through honesty, transparency, and ethical behavior. This includes avoiding conflicts of interest, disclosing information to the public, and making decisions that are in the public interest. For example, a public servant who is entrusted with the responsibility of allocating government contracts should ensure that the process is transparent, fair, and impartial, and that contracts are awarded to the most qualified and capable bidders.
    
2.  Upholding the law: Fortitude in public service is demonstrated through the courage to uphold the law and resist corrupt or unethical influences. This includes taking a stand against corruption, political interference, and other forms of misconduct, and taking action to bring wrongdoers to justice. For example, a public servant who is aware of corruption in a government project should take appropriate action to report the wrongdoing, and resist any pressure to remain silent or look the other way.
    
3.  Acting impartially: Impartiality and non-partisanship are important principles of public service that are manifested through the ability to act objectively and without bias. This includes avoiding personal interests and biases, and making decisions that are in the best interests of the public.

1. A mere compliance with law is not enough, the public servant also has to have a well-developed sensibility to ethical issues for effective discharge of duties." Do you agree?

```ad-Answer

I agree with the statement that mere compliance with law is not enough for an effective discharge of duties by a public servant. A well-developed sensibility to ethical issues is also essential.

I. An act that is ethically right, but not legally:

1.  Example: Whistleblowing
    
    -   Whistleblowing refers to the act of reporting unethical or illegal activities within an organization, usually by an employee.
    -   Although it is ethically the right thing to do, as it helps to address harmful practices and promote accountability, it is not always protected by law.
    -   In many cases, whistleblowers face retaliation from their employers and face difficulties in finding employment in the future.
2.  Importance of ethical sensibility:
    
    -   In such a scenario, a public servant with a well-developed sensibility to ethical issues would still choose to report the unethical activities, even if it is not legally protected.
    -   This shows a commitment to ethical principles, such as transparency and accountability, that go beyond legal compliance.
    -   It also demonstrates that the public servant is willing to take personal risks to uphold these principles, which is an important attribute of effective leadership.

II. An act that is legally right, but not ethically:

1.  Example: Insider Trading
    
    -   Insider trading refers to the practice of using confidential information for financial gain in the stock market.
    -   Although it is not illegal in some countries, it is widely considered to be unethical.
    -   The reason for this is that insider trading takes advantage of unequal access to information, and it undermines public trust in the fairness of the financial markets.
2.  Importance of ethical sensibility:
    
    -   In this scenario, a public servant with a well-developed sensibility to ethical issues would avoid engaging in insider trading, even if it is not illegal.
    -   This shows a commitment to ethical principles, such as fairness and justice, that go beyond legal compliance.
    -   It also demonstrates that the public servant is willing to act in the public interest, even if it means forgoing personal financial gain, which is an important attribute of effective leadership.

```ad-Answer

a) Bureaucratic Attitude and Democratic Attitude:

Bureaucratic Attitude: The bureaucratic attitude is characterized by a focus on rules and procedures, formalities, and hierarchy. In this approach, the role of public servants is to implement the policies and laws as they are written, without much room for discretion or creativity. Public servants who adopt this attitude view themselves as impartial and neutral, responsible only for following the rules. The merits of bureaucratic attitude are:

1.  Consistency: Bureaucratic procedures ensure consistency in the way decisions are made, which can help to prevent corruption and biases.
    
2.  Efficient implementation of policies: Bureaucratic rules and procedures can help to ensure the efficient implementation of policies and programs.
    
3.  Expertise: Bureaucratic systems can take advantage of the specialized expertise of public servants, who can bring their technical knowledge to bear on complex problems.
    

The demerits of bureaucratic attitude are:

1.  Lack of flexibility: Bureaucratic procedures can make it difficult to respond quickly to changing circumstances, making it hard to be responsive to citizens' needs.
    
2.  Rigidity: Bureaucratic attitudes can lead to a rigid approach to problem-solving, which can prevent public servants from being creative or innovative in their work.
    
3.  Lack of accountability: Bureaucratic attitudes can sometimes lead to a lack of accountability, as public servants view themselves as neutral implementers of rules and procedures rather than accountable to citizens.
    

Democratic Attitude: The democratic attitude, on the other hand, is characterized by a focus on citizens and their needs. In this approach, the role of public servants is to engage with citizens, listen to their concerns, and find ways to address their needs. Public servants who adopt this attitude view themselves as accountable to citizens, and see their work as a way to promote the public good. The merits of democratic attitude are:

1.  Citizen-centered approach: By engaging with citizens and considering their needs, public servants can ensure that the policies and programs they implement are responsive to the needs of the people.
    
2.  Increased accountability: By viewing themselves as accountable to citizens, public servants are more likely to act in the public interest, which can help to increase the transparency and accountability of government.
    
3.  Increased creativity: By engaging with citizens, public servants can gain a deeper understanding of the problems they face and can find new and innovative solutions to these problems.
    

The demerits of democratic attitude are:

1.  Lack of consistency: A democratic approach to problem-solving can sometimes lead to inconsistent decisions, as different public servants may have different interpretations of what citizens need.
    
2.  Slow decision-making: The process of engaging with citizens and considering their needs can sometimes slow down the decision-making process, making it difficult to respond quickly to emergencies.
    
3.  Political bias: Public servants who adopt a democratic attitude may be more susceptible to political biases and pressures, which can impact the impartiality and non-partisanship of government.
    

b) Balancing the Two Attitudes:

While both bureaucratic and democratic attitudes have their strengths and weaknesses, it is possible to balance the two to create a better administration. By combining the efficiency and consistency of bureaucratic procedures with the responsiveness and accountability of a democratic approach, public servants can achieve a better balance between rules and flexibility, between technical expertise and citizen engagement. This balance can help to create a more efficient and effective administration, better able to meet the needs of citizens.

"Accountability" in the context of public service refers to the responsibility and answerability of public servants to explain their actions and decision-making processes to the public, elected officials, and other stakeholders. This involves a commitment to transparency, honesty, and ethical behavior in fulfilling their duties and responsibilities.

Measures to ensure individual and collective accountability of public servants are:

1.  Codes of Conduct: Establishing clear codes of conduct for public servants that outline ethical standards and expectations for behavior can help to promote accountability. This can include guidelines for avoiding conflicts of interest, ethical decision-making, and reporting suspected misconduct.
    
2.  Performance Evaluations: Regular performance evaluations of public servants can help to assess their performance, identify areas for improvement, and encourage accountability. Performance evaluations can also be used to identify and address ethical lapses or misconduct.
    
3.  Internal Controls: Implementing internal controls within public service organizations can help to prevent unethical behavior and promote accountability. This can include segregation of duties, checks and balances, and regular audits.
    
4.  Public reporting: Providing regular, transparent reporting on the activities of public servants can increase accountability by making their actions and decision-making processes more visible to the public. This can include regular financial reports, performance reports, and other forms of communication.
    
5.  Oversight Bodies: Establishing independent oversight bodies, such as inspector generals, ombudsmen, or ethics committees, can help to ensure accountability by providing a mechanism for investigating complaints, reviewing decisions, and holding public servants accountable for their actions.
    
6.  Consequences for Misconduct: Establishing clear consequences for misconduct, such as termination, disciplinary action, or criminal penalties, can help to deter unethical behavior and promote accountability.
    
7.  Whistleblower Protections: Implementing measures to protect whistleblowers can help to encourage public servants to report unethical behavior and promote accountability. This can include confidentiality, protection from retaliation, and a fair and transparent process for investigating complaints.
    

By implementing these measures, public service organizations can ensure that public servants are accountable for their actions and decision-making processes, and that they are held to high ethical standards in the fulfillment of their duties. This can help to promote trust in government, improve the quality of public services, and advance the public interest.

This statement highlights the importance of having both knowledge and integrity. In this context, "integrity" refers to moral principles, values, and ethical standards that guide one's behavior and actions. On the other hand, "knowledge" refers to an understanding and awareness of information and skills acquired through education and experience.

Here's my take on this statement with illustrations from the modern context:

1.  Integrity without knowledge: In this scenario, a person may have strong values and moral principles, but lacks the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. As a result, their efforts may not yield the desired results and may even harm themselves or others. For example, a well-intentioned individual who lacks knowledge about medicine may harm someone by administering the wrong treatment.
    
2.  Knowledge without integrity: In this scenario, a person may have a vast array of information and skills but lacks moral values and ethical standards. In such a case, their knowledge and skills can be used for harmful purposes, causing harm to others. For example, a highly skilled hacker who lacks ethical standards may use their skills to steal sensitive information and cause harm.
    
3.  The Importance of Both: The combination of knowledge and integrity is crucial for individuals to use their skills and information for the greater good. Knowledge enables individuals to make informed decisions, while integrity guides them to act in a morally and ethically responsible manner. For example, a doctor who possesses both knowledge and integrity will use their medical skills to help their patients while upholding their ethical obligations to maintain patient confidentiality.
    

In the modern context, the importance of knowledge and integrity can be seen in various fields, such as politics, business, and technology. In politics, leaders with knowledge and integrity can make informed decisions that benefit their constituents and the greater good. In business, executives who possess both knowledge and integrity can lead their organizations towards success while also treating their employees and customers fairly. In technology, experts with both knowledge and integrity can use their skills to create innovative solutions that improve people's lives while also respecting privacy and ethical considerations.

Case Study: politicization of bureaucracy (2019)

In a modern democratic polity, there is a concept of the political executive and permanent
executive elected people’s representatives forms the political executive and bureaucracy form
the permanent executive. Ministers frame policy decisions and bureaucrats execute these. In
the initial decades after independence, the relationship between the permanent executives and
the political executives were characterized by mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation,
without encroaching upon each other’s domain.
However, in subsequent decades, the situation has changed. There are instances of the political
executive insisting upon the permanent executives to follow its agenda. Respect for an appreciation of upright bureaucrats has declined. There is an increasing tendency among the political executive to get involved in routine administrative matters such as transfers, posting etc. Under this scenario, there is a definitive trend towards ‘politicization of bureaucracy’. The rising materialism and acquisitiveness in social life has also adversely impacted upon the ethical values of both the permanent executive and the political executive.

What are the consequences of this ‘politicization of bureaucracy? Discuss

```ad-Answer



The ‘politicization of bureaucracy’ has far-reaching consequences on the functioning of the government and the society at large. It has led to a situation where the political executive has begun to interfere in the functioning of the permanent executive, leading to a breakdown of the mutual understanding, respect and cooperation that were once the hallmarks of the relationship between the two.

The first and foremost consequence of the politicization of bureaucracy is the erosion of public trust in the government. When bureaucrats are seen to be acting in accordance with the whims and fancies of the political executive, rather than in the interest of the public, it leads to a lack of confidence in the government. This lack of trust further leads to a lack of public participation in the policy making process, which in turn leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of the government’s policies.

The politicization of bureaucracy has also led to a decrease in the efficiency of the bureaucracy. When bureaucrats are forced to act in accordance with the agendas of the political executive, rather than in accordance with the rules and regulations of the government, it leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the bureaucracy. This decrease in efficiency leads to a decrease in the quality of services provided by the government and a decrease in the overall effectiveness of the government in providing services to the public.

Another consequence of the politicization of bureaucracy is the rise of corruption in the bureaucracy. When the political executive begins to interfere in the functioning of the bureaucracy, it leads to a situation where bureaucrats are more likely to engage in corrupt practices in order to curry favor with the political executive. This leads to a decrease in the quality of services provided by the government and an increase in the cost of doing business with the government.

Finally, the politicization of bureaucracy has led to a decrease in the ethical values of both the political executive and the permanent executive. When the political executive begins to interfere in the functioning of the bureaucracy, it leads to a situation where both the political executive and the permanent executive are more likely to engage in unethical practices in order to gain favor with the political executive. This leads to a decrease in the ethical standards of the government, which in turn leads to a decrease in the overall effectiveness of the government in providing services to the public.
