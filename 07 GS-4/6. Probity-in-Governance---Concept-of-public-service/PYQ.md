1.  Clarity of Expectations: The charter clearly defines the rights, responsibilities and expectations of citizens in relation to the delivery of public services.
    
2.  Accessibility: The charter ensures that information about public services is easily accessible and understandable to citizens.
    
3.  Responsiveness: The charter requires public servants to be responsive to the needs of citizens and to provide quality services within a reasonable time frame.
    
4.  Transparency: The charter promotes transparency by providing information about the process of decision-making and the criteria used to allocate resources.
    
5.  Participation: The charter allows citizens to participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of public services.
    
6.  Accountability: The charter establishes clear lines of accountability and makes public servants responsible for delivering quality services.

It also provides citizens with an opportunity to have a say in the design and delivery of public services. By promoting transparency, the charter helps to reduce corruption and increase the efficiency of public services.

Effective utilization of public funds is crucial for achieving development goals and improving the standard of living of citizens. However, in many countries, public funds are often under-utilized or mis-utilized, leading to a significant waste of resources. Some of the reasons for under-utilization and mis-utilization of public funds are as follows:

1.  Lack of transparency and accountability: The absence of proper mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the utilization of public funds makes it easier for corruption and mismanagement to occur.
    
2.  Inefficient systems and processes: Bureaucratic red tape, complex procedures and lack of streamlined processes often result in delays and under-utilization of funds.
    
3.  Political interference: Political influence in the allocation and utilization of public funds can lead to a skewed distribution of resources and mis-utilization of funds.
    
4.  Lack of proper planning and budgeting: The absence of a comprehensive and well-planned budget can lead to under-utilization of funds and mismanagement of resources.
    

The implications of under-utilization and mis-utilization of public funds are far-reaching and can have a significant impact on the development goals of a country. Some of these implications are:

1.  Reduced economic growth: Mis-utilization of public funds can lead to reduced economic growth and slow down the pace of development.
    
2.  Increased poverty: When public funds are not effectively utilized, the poor and vulnerable sections of society are the worst affected, leading to increased poverty and inequality.
    
3.  Loss of public trust: Corruption and mismanagement of public funds can erode public trust in the government and its institutions.
    
4.  Wasted resources: The mis-utilization of public funds leads to a waste of resources that could have been used to achieve development goals.
    
5.  Inadequate public services: Under-utilization of public funds can result in inadequate public services and infrastructure, affecting the quality of life of citizens.

1. “Non-performance of duty by a public servant is a form of corruption” Do you agree with this view? Justify your answer. ("लोक सेवक द्वारा अपने कर्तव्य का अनिष्पादन भ्रष्टाचार का एक रूप है।" क्या आप इस विचार से सहमत हैं ? अपने उत्तर की तर्कसं गत व्याख्या करें।) 2019

```ad-Answer

The statement that “non-performance of duty by a public servant is a form of corruption” is largely accurate. A public servant is an individual who is employed by the government to perform a specific task or duty for the benefit of the public. When a public servant fails to fulfill their duty, it can be considered a form of corruption.

Corruption can take many forms, including bribery, embezzlement, and nepotism. However, non-performance of duty can also be considered a form of corruption. This is because it goes against the very purpose of the public servant’s role, which is to serve the public. When a public servant fails to fulfill their duty, it can have a negative impact on the public, as well as the government.

For example, if a public servant is responsible for overseeing the construction of a public facility, such as a school or hospital, and fails to do so, it can result in the project being delayed or even abandoned. This can lead to the public not receiving the services they need and the government not being able to provide them with the necessary resources.

In addition, when a public servant fails to fulfill their duty, it can also lead to a lack of accountability and transparency. This can create an environment where corruption is more likely to occur, as there is no one to ensure that the public servant is doing their job properly.

1. What is meant by conflict of interest? Illustrate with examples, the difference between the
actual and potential conflicts of interest. (हित-विरोधिता से क्या तात्पर्य है ? वास्तविक और सं भावित हित-विरोधिताओ के बीच ं के अंतर को उदाहरणो द्ं वारा स्पष्ट कीजिए।) 2018

```ad-Answer

Conflict of interest refers to a situation in which an individual or an organization has competing interests, obligations, or loyalties that interfere with each other. When someone is faced with conflicting interests, they must choose which of their competing interests to prioritize, which can result in ethical dilemmas. Conflicts of interest can arise in both the public and private sectors, and they can negatively impact decision-making, reputation, and trust.

There are two types of conflicts of interest: actual and potential.

Actual conflict of interest refers to a situation in which an individual's personal interests or financial gain directly conflicts with their professional obligations. For example, a city council member who owns a construction company and votes to award a contract to that company would be in an actual conflict of interest. The council member's financial interests in the construction company would directly interfere with their responsibility to act in the best interest of their constituents.

Potential conflict of interest refers to a situation in which an individual's personal interests or financial gain might conflict with their professional obligations. For example, a public official who has a financial interest in a company that could potentially benefit from a government decision they will be involved in would be in a potential conflict of interest. The official's personal financial interests might not directly interfere with their professional obligations, but there is a possibility that they could in the future.

It is important to differentiate between actual and potential conflicts of interest because they are not equal in terms of their ethical implications. Actual conflicts of interest can lead to serious ethical violations and legal consequences, while potential conflicts of interest may simply raise concerns about impartiality or the appearance of impropriety.

In conclusion, conflicts of interest can have a negative impact on the reputation and trust of an individual or an organization. It is crucial for individuals and organizations to identify and manage actual and potential conflicts of interest in order to maintain their credibility and integrity. This can be done through implementing conflict of interest policies, regularly disclosing financial interests, and seeking guidance when faced with conflicting interests.

Fathers should also be supportive and encouraging in their children’s education and motivate them to pursue their dreams.

Mothers are the nurturers of the family and play a crucial role in the development of their children. They should instill in their children the values of compassion, empathy and kindness. Mothers should also be supportive and encouraging in their children’s education and help them develop their skills and talents. They should also teach their children the importance of honesty, integrity and hard work.

Teachers are the torchbearers of knowledge and have a major role in the development of their students. They should be role models for their students, showing them the right path and teaching them the values of honesty, integrity and responsibility. They should also be supportive and encouraging in their students’ education and help them develop their skills and talents.

In conclusion, it is clear that the father, the mother and the teacher are the three key societal members who can make a country corruption free and a nation of beautiful minds. They should be role models for their children and students, showing them the right path and teaching them the values of honesty, integrity and responsibility.

1. It is often said that poverty leads to corruption. However, there is no dearth of instances where affluent and powerful people indulge in corruption in a big way. What are the basic causes of corruption among people? Support your answer with examples. (अक्सर कहा जाता है कि निर्धनता भ्रष्टाचार की ओर प्रवृत करती है। परन्, ऐसे भी उदाहरण की कोई कमी नही तु है जहां सं पन्न एवं ं शक्तिशाली लोग बड़ी मात्रा में भ्रष्टाचार में लिप्त हो जाते हैं। लोगो में ंव्याप्त भ्रष्टाचार के आधारभूत कारण क्या है? उदाहरणो के द् ं वारा अपने उत्तर को सम्पुष्ट कीजिए।) 2014

```ad-Answer

Corruption is a complex and multi-faceted issue that affects societies across the world, regardless of their economic, political, or cultural systems. It is a violation of ethical and moral values and is detrimental to the development and progress of a nation. The causes of corruption can be divided into individual, systemic, and cultural factors.

Individual factors refer to the personal characteristics and motivations of those who engage in corrupt activities. These may include greed, power, and a desire for wealth and material gain. A lack of moral or ethical values, and a disregard for the welfare of others can also contribute to corrupt behavior.

Systemic factors refer to the structures, policies, and institutions that create an environment conducive to corruption. For example, a lack of transparency and accountability in government, weak law enforcement, and an ineffective judiciary can create opportunities for corruption to flourish. Additionally, an unequal distribution of resources and opportunities can lead to unequal power relationships, with the powerful and affluent having more opportunities to engage in corrupt practices.

Cultural factors refer to the attitudes and norms that exist in a society that either promote or discourage corruption. A culture of tolerance for corruption, or a lack of public outrage when it is exposed, can contribute to its persistence. Additionally, corruption can be seen as acceptable or even desirable in some cultures, if it is perceived as a means of achieving personal or collective goals.

Examples of corruption can be seen at all levels of society, from petty bribes paid to traffic officers to large-scale embezzlement by senior government officials. The prevalence of corruption in developing countries is often attributed to systemic factors such as weak governance, poor regulation, and a lack of political will to tackle the issue. In developed countries, corruption can be found in both the public and private sectors, and can take many forms, including bribery, nepotism, and insider trading.

In conclusion, the causes of corruption are complex and interrelated, encompassing individual, systemic, and cultural factors. To effectively tackle corruption, it is necessary to address the underlying causes at all levels, from individual behavior to systemic and cultural norms. This requires a concerted effort from government, civil society, and individuals to promote transparency, accountability, and ethical behavior.

Ramesh’s mother has recently been detected cancer and has been admitted in the leading cancer hospital of the city. His two adolescent children have also got admission in one of the best public schools of the town. After settling down in his appointment as Director in the Home Department of the State, Ramesh got confidential report through intelligence sources that illegal migrants are infiltrating in the State from the neighbouring country. He decided to personally carry out surprise check of the border posts along with his Home Department team. To his surprise, he caught red-handed two families of 12 members infiltrated with the connivance of the security personnel at the border posts. On further inquiry and investigation, it was found that after the migrants from neighbouring country infiltrate, their documentation like Aadhaar Card, Ration Card and Voter Card are also forged and they are made to settle down in a particular area of the State. Ramesh prepared the detailed and comprehensive report and submitted to the Additional Secretary of the State. However, he has summoned by the Additional Home Secretary after a week and was instructed to withdraw the report. The Additional Home Secretary informed Ramesh that the report submitted by him has not been appreciated by the higher authorities. He further cautioned him that if he fails to withdraw the confidential ort, he will not only be posted out from the prestigious appointment from the State capital but his further promotion which is due in near future will also get in jeopardy.

3.  The evaluation of the options: a. Withdrawing the report: This option may provide temporary relief but would be against the principles of honesty and integrity of a civil servant. It would also be a violation of Ramesh’s duty to report any illegal activities to the relevant authorities. b. Standing by the report: This option may have consequences such as transfer, loss of promotion, or harassment. However, this option upholds the integrity of the civil services and the principles of ethical conduct. c. Filing a complaint: This option would bring the matter to the attention of the relevant authorities, but it may not guarantee a favorable outcome. It may also result in further harassment and retaliation. d. Seeking legal opinion: This option would be useful if Ramesh feels that his rights as a civil servant have been violated. However, it may be a lengthy process and may not provide a quick solution.
    
4.  The ethical dilemmas being faced by Ramesh are: a. Loyalty to the employer (the state) versus duty to report any illegal activities. b. Fear of retaliation and loss of job security versus upholding ethical conduct and integrity of the civil services. c. Personal interests (such as his mother's health and children's education) versus duty to serve the state and the nation.
    
5.  To combat the menace of infiltration of illegal migrants, the following policy measures could be implemented: a. Strengthening the security at the border posts with the deployment of additional personnel. b. Adopting advanced technology such as biometric identification to prevent forgery of documentation. c. Improving intelligence gathering and analysis to detect and prevent illegal infiltration. d. Regular monitoring and supervision of the security personnel to prevent any connivance with the illegal migrants. e. Strict punishment for those who are found to be involved in facilitating the illegal infiltration, including security personnel and officials. f. Creating awareness among the public about the dangers of illegal infiltration and the need to report any suspicious activities to the relevant authorities.
    

In conclusion, Ramesh is facing a difficult ethical dilemma, but the most appropriate option would be to stand by the report and face the consequences. This would uphold the integrity of the civil services and the principles of ethical conduct. To combat the menace of infiltration of illegal migrants, policy measures such as strengthening border security, improving intelligence gathering, and strict punishment for those involved in illegal activities should be implemented.

Police filed FIR but no breakthrough was achieved in the case for almost three months. Ashok who was the Investigative Journalist working with leading TV channel, suo moto started investigating the case. Within one month, Ashok got breakthrough by interacting with local people, stone mining masia and government officials. He prepared his investigative story and presented to the CMD of the TV channel. He exposed in his investigative report the complete nexus of stone mafia working with blessing of corrupt police and civil officials and politicians. The politician who was involved in the mafia was no one else but local MLA who was considered to be very close to the Chief Minister. After going through the investigative report, the CMD advised Ashok to drop the idea of making the story public through electronic media. He informed that the local MLA was not only the relative of the owner of the TV channel but also had unofficially 20 percent share in the channel. The CMD further informed Ashok that his further promotion and hike in pay will be taken care of in addition the soft loan of 10 lakhs which he has taken from the TV channel for his son’s chronic disease will be suitably adjusted if he hands over the investigative report to him.

2. Critically evaluate/examine each of the options identified by Ashok.
3. What are the ethical dilemmas being faced by Ashok?
4. Which of the options, do you think, would be the most appropriate for Ashok to adopt and why?
5. In the above scenario, what type of training would you suggest for police officers posted to such districts where stone mining illegal activities are rampant?

```ad-Answer

1.  The options available to Ashok are: 
a. To drop the story and not make it public. 
b. To go ahead and make the story public despite the pressure from the CMD. 
c. To take the matter to a higher authority, such as the press council or the court. 
d. To quit his job and find a new employer who will allow him to air the story.
    
2.  Option a would mean that Ashok would be compromising on his ethics as a journalist and allowing corruption to continue. 
Option b would result in potential harm to Ashok, as well as the TV channel, but it would be in line with his duty as a journalist to uncover the truth. 
Option c would be a viable alternative if Ashok felt that his safety was at risk, but it may not necessarily result in the story being aired. 
Option d would allow Ashok to continue his work as a journalist, but he would have to start from scratch and may not have the same reach as he currently has with the TV channel.
    
3.  The ethical dilemmas faced by Ashok are: 
a. The duty to uncover the truth and report on it, versus the pressure to keep quiet for personal and professional reasons. b. The duty to not compromise on his principles and ethics as a journalist, versus the pressure to do so for financial gain. 
c. The duty to ensure the safety and well-being of himself and his family, versus the pressure to report on a potentially dangerous story.
    
4.  The most appropriate option for Ashok would be option b, to go ahead and make the story public, despite the pressure from the CMD. This is because it aligns with his duty as a journalist to uncover the truth and report on it, without compromising on his ethics and principles.
    
5.  The type of training that would be appropriate for police officers posted to districts where illegal stone mining activities are rampant would be training in ethics and integrity, as well as in investigative techniques. The police officers should be trained to not be swayed by bribes or pressure from corrupt politicians or other officials, and to carry out their duties with honesty and impartiality. Additionally, the officers should be trained to handle dangerous situations, such as those that the young SP encountered, in a manner that minimizes the risk of harm to themselves and others.

Sunil is a young civil servant and has a reputation for his competence, integrity, dedication and relentlessness in pursuit of difficult and onerous jobs. Considering his profile, he was picked up by his bosses to handle a very challenging and sensitive assignment. He was posted in a tribal-dominated district notorious for illegal sand mining. Excavating sand from river belts and transporting it through trucks and selling them in the black market was rampant. This illegal sand mining mafia was operating with the support of local functionaries and tribal musclemen who in turn were bribing selected poor tribals and had kept the tribals under fear and intimidation. Sunil being a sharp and energetic officer immediately grasped the ground realities and the modus operandi followed by the mafia through their devious and dubious mechanism. On making inquiries, he gathered that some of their own office employees are in hand and glove with them and have developed close unholy nexus. Sunil initiated stringent action against them and started conducting raids on their illegal operations of the movement of trucks filled with sand. The mafia got rattled as not many officers in the past had taken such strong steps against the mafia. Some of the office employees who were allegedly close to the mafia informed them that the officer is determined to clean up the mafia’s illegal sand mining operations in that district and may cause them irreparable damage. The mafia turned hostile and launched a counter-offensive. The tribal musclemen and mafia started threatening him with dire consequences. His family (wife and old mother) were stalked and were under virtual surveillance and thus causing mental torture, agony and stress to all of them. The matter assumed serious proportions when a muscleman came to his office and threatened him to stop raids etc., otherwise, his fate will not be different than some of his predecessors (ten years back one officer was killed by the mafia)

1. Identify the different options available to Sunil in attending this situation
2. Critically evaluate each of the options listed by you.
3. Which of the above, do you think, would be most appropriate for Sunil to adopt and why?

```ad-Answer

1.  Options available to Sunil in attending this situation: a) Continuing the raids and cracking down on the illegal sand mining mafia 
b) Seeking help from higher authorities in the government and seeking protection 
c) Relinquishing the assignment and seeking a transfer to another district 
d) Going public with the matter and seeking support from civil society organizations and the media
    
2.  Evaluation of each option: 
a) Continuing the raids and cracking down on the illegal sand mining mafia - This option requires Sunil to be determined, brave, and relentless in his efforts. While it may result in stopping the illegal sand mining, it may also lead to a dangerous situation, where Sunil's life may be in danger. Moreover, it could lead to a lack of support from other government officials who are reportedly colluding with the mafia. 
b) Seeking help from higher authorities in the government and seeking protection - This option involves seeking support from his superiors and the government. This may provide Sunil with the necessary resources and protection to continue his efforts against the illegal sand mining mafia. However, there is no guarantee that the higher authorities will be able to provide adequate protection, and there is also the possibility that they may be part of the corruption. 
c) Relinquishing the assignment and seeking a transfer to another district - This option allows Sunil to escape the threats and danger posed by the illegal sand mining mafia. However, it may be seen as giving up on the fight against corruption and could harm Sunil's reputation as a competent and dedicated officer. 
d) Going public with the matter and seeking support from civil society organizations and the media - This option involves making the public aware of the illegal sand mining and seeking their support in stopping it. This can lead to increased pressure on the government and the mafia to put an end to the illegal sand mining. However, it may also put Sunil and his family in greater danger, as the mafia may target them for speaking out.
    
3.  Most appropriate option for Sunil: In my opinion, the most appropriate option for Sunil would be to seek help from higher authorities in the government and seek protection. This option provides Sunil with the resources and protection necessary to continue his efforts against the illegal sand mining mafia, while also avoiding the danger posed by going public with the matter. However, it is important for Sunil to be cautious and thoroughly evaluate the higher authorities he is seeking help from, to ensure that they are not part of the corruption. Additionally, seeking protection should be accompanied by an effort to build a strong case against the illegal sand mining mafia, with concrete evidence and witness statements, to ensure that they are brought to justice.

Case Study: Corruption in Municipal Construction (2020)

You are a Municipal Commissioner of a large city, having the reputation of a very honest and upright officer. A huge multipurpose mall is under construction in your city in which a large number of daily wage earners are employed. One night, during monsoons, a big chunk of the roof collapsed causing instant death of four labourers including two minors. Many more were seriously injured requiring immediate medical attention. The mishap resulted in a big hue and cry, forcing the government to institute an enquiry. Your preliminary enquiry has revealed a series of anomalies. The material used for the construction was of poor quality. Despite the approved building plans permitting only one basement, an additional basement has been constructed. This was overlooked during the periodic inspections by the building inspector of the municipal corporation. In your enquiry, you noticed that the construction of the mall was given the green signal despite encroaching on areas earmarked for a green belt and a slip road in the Zonal Master Plan of the city. The permission to construct the mall was accorded by the previous Municipal Commissioner who is not only your senior and well known to you professionally, but also a good friend. Prima facie, the case appears to be of a widespread nexus between officials of the Municipal Corporation and the builders. Your colleagues are putting pressure on you to go slow in the enquiry. The builder, who is rich and influential, happens to be a close relative of a powerful minister in the state cabinet. The builder is persuading you to hush up the matter, promising you a fortune to do so. He also hinted that if this matter is not resolved at the earliest in his favour there is somebody in his office who is waiting to file a case against you under the POSH act. Discuss the ethical issues involved in the case. What are the options available to you in this situation? Explain your selected course of action.

```ad-Answer

The ethical issues involved in this case are complex and numerous. On one hand, there is the pressure to cover up the truth and avoid a potential conflict with a powerful minister and a wealthy builder. On the other hand, there is the obligation to uphold the law, ensure justice for the victims, and maintain the integrity of the Municipal Corporation. Additionally, there is the risk of a personal attack in the form of a false complaint under the POSH act.

In this situation, the options available to the Municipal Commissioner are:

1.  Cover up the truth: This option would involve ignoring the evidence of wrongdoing, overlooking the anomalies in the construction of the mall, and succumbing to the pressure from the builder and his allies. This would be unethical and would undermine the credibility of the Municipal Corporation and the Municipal Commissioner.
    
2.  Proceed with the enquiry: This option would involve conducting a fair and thorough investigation into the anomalies in the construction of the mall and taking appropriate action based on the evidence. This would uphold the law and maintain the integrity of the Municipal Corporation, but could result in conflict with the powerful minister and builder, and possibly a personal attack in the form of a false complaint.
    
3.  Seek outside help: This option would involve seeking assistance from higher authorities, such as the Chief Minister or the Anti-Corruption Bureau, to ensure a fair and impartial investigation. This would reduce the risk of personal attack, but could result in political fallout and potential career risks.
    

Given these options, the selected course of action for the Municipal Commissioner should be to proceed with the enquiry, but seek outside help to ensure a fair and impartial investigation. This would demonstrate the Commissioner's commitment to upholding the law and maintaining the integrity of the Municipal Corporation, while also reducing the risk of personal attack. Additionally, it would ensure that justice is served for the victims and that the truth is uncovered, regardless of the political or financial consequences.

In conclusion, the Municipal Commissioner must act with integrity and courage in the face of the numerous ethical challenges posed by this situation. By seeking outside help and proceeding with a fair and impartial enquiry, the Commissioner can demonstrate his commitment to upholding the law and maintaining the integrity of the Municipal Corporation, while also ensuring justice for the victims and uncovering the truth.

Case-study: Obliging to Minister’s Wishes for Land-Deal (2018)

As a senior officer in the Ministry, you have access to important policy decisions and upcoming big announcements such as road constructions projects before they are notified in the public domain. The Ministry is about to announce a mega road project for which the drawings are already in place. Sufficient care was taken by the planners to make use of the government land with the minimum land acquisition from private parties. Compensation rate for private parties was also finalized as per government rules. Care was also taken to minimize deforestation. Once the project is announced, it is expected that there will be a huge spurt in real estate prices in and around that area. Meanwhile, the Minister concerned insists that you realign the road in such a way that it comes closer to his 20 acres farmhouse. He also suggests that he would facilitate the purchase of a big plot of land in your wife name at the prevailing rate which is very nominal, in and around the proposed mega road project. He also tries to convince you by saying that there is no harm in it as he is buying the land legally. He even promises to supplement your savings in case you do not have sufficient funds to buy the land. However, by the act of realignment, a lot of agricultural lands has to be acquired, thereby causing a considerable financial burden on the government, and also the displacement of the farmers. As if this is not enough, it will involve cutting down of a large number of trees denuding the area of its green cover. Faced with this situation, what will you do? Critically examine various conflicts of interest and explain what your responsibilities are as a public servant

Case-Study: Illegal Building Collapse? (2017)

A building permitted for three floors, while being extended illegally to 6 floors by a builder, collapses. As a consequence, a number of innocent labourers including women and children died. These labourers are migrants of different places. The government immediately announced cash relief to the aggrieved families and arrested the builder. Give reasons for such incidents taking place across the country. Suggest measures to prevent their occurrence.

```ad-Answer

Such incidents of building collapses are a tragic and unfortunate reality in many parts of the country. The reasons for these incidents are as follows:

1.  Lack of proper regulations: In many cases, there are inadequate regulations and enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure that buildings are constructed safely and in accordance with standards.
    
2.  Corruption: Corruption and bribery are major contributors to the problem, with builders often paying off officials to ignore safety regulations and extend buildings illegally.
    
3.  Lack of safety inspections: Many buildings are constructed without proper safety inspections and certifications, making them vulnerable to collapses in the event of natural disasters or other stressors.
    
4.  Use of substandard materials: The use of substandard or low-quality materials in construction is also a significant factor in building collapses.
    
5.  Overcrowding: Many buildings are constructed with an increased number of floors to accommodate more people, putting additional stress on the structure and increasing the risk of collapse.
    

To prevent these incidents from occurring, the following measures can be taken:

1.  Strict enforcement of regulations: Governments should enforce existing regulations more strictly, including penalties for non-compliance and regular inspections of buildings to ensure that they are being constructed safely.
    
2.  Zero tolerance for corruption: Governments should implement anti-corruption measures to prevent bribery and corruption in the construction industry.
    
3.  Improved safety inspections: Building inspectors should be trained and equipped to carry out regular and thorough safety inspections, and the results of these inspections should be made publicly available.
    
4.  Use of quality materials: Governments should encourage the use of quality construction materials and provide incentives for builders who use them.
    
5.  Strict monitoring of overcrowding: Governments should enforce regulations that limit overcrowding in buildings, such as limiting the number of floors that can be added to a building.
    
6.  Awareness campaigns: Governments should launch awareness campaigns to educate the public about the importance of building safety and the dangers of ignoring regulations.
    
7.  Proper compensation for victims: Governments should ensure that adequate compensation is provided to the families of victims in the event of building collapses.

Case-Study: Opinion as Honest Officer (2017)

You are an honest and responsible civil servant. You often observe the following:

1. There is a general perception that adhering to ethical conduct one may face difficulties to oneself and cause problems for the family, whereas unfair practices may help to reach the career goals.
2. When the number of people adopting unfair means is large, a small minority having a penchant towards ethical means makes no difference.
3. Sticking to ethical means is detrimental to the larger developmental goals
4. While one may not involve oneself in large unethical practices, but giving and accepting small gifts makes the system more efficient.
5. Examine the above statements with their merits and demerits.

```ad-Answer

The statements mentioned raise several ethical concerns regarding the conduct of civil servants. Here's a closer look at each of the statements:

1.  Perception of Adhering to Ethical Conduct: This statement suggests that there is a general belief that ethical conduct may hinder personal and professional growth. This is a dangerous mindset, as it undermines the importance of integrity and morality in public service. Ethical conduct is essential for maintaining trust and confidence in the government and its institutions. While it may be difficult to adhere to ethical standards, it is the responsibility of civil servants to uphold them, even if it comes at a personal cost.
    
2.  Majority Adopting Unfair Means: The idea that a small minority of people following ethical conduct makes no difference is incorrect. The actions of individuals, no matter how small, can have a cumulative impact on the larger system. A large number of people following unethical practices may seem overwhelming, but it is important to remember that every act of integrity can serve as an inspiration for others to follow. Civil servants must lead by example and demonstrate that ethical conduct is not only the right thing to do, but also beneficial in the long run.
    
3.  Ethical Conduct Hindering Development: The suggestion that sticking to ethical means is detrimental to larger developmental goals is also flawed. On the contrary, ethical conduct is essential for sustainable development. Unfair practices, corruption, and unethical behavior undermine the stability and integrity of institutions, which can negatively impact economic growth and social development. A society built on ethical principles is more likely to achieve its developmental goals in a fair and sustainable manner.
    
4.  Giving and Accepting Gifts: The notion that giving and accepting small gifts makes the system more efficient is problematic. Gifts, even if small, can create a conflict of interest and compromise the impartiality of civil servants. They can also be seen as bribes, which is illegal. The most efficient system is one where decisions are made based on merit, not influenced by personal gain.
    

In conclusion, each of the above statements raises serious ethical concerns about the conduct of civil servants. Adhering to ethical standards is not only a legal requirement but also a moral obligation. Civil servants must lead by example and uphold the highest standards of integrity and impartiality, even if it comes at a personal cost. Only then can they serve the best interests of the people they serve and contribute to a fair and just society.

Case-Study: "Shivaji-the Boss": Movie Plot (2016)

Saraswati was a successful IT professional in USA. Moved by the patriotic sense of doing something for the country she returned to India. Together with some other like-minded friends, she formed an NGO to build a school for a poor rural community. The objective of the school was to provide the best quality modern education at a nominal cost. She soon discovered that she has to seek permission from a number of Governments agencies. The rules and procedures were quite confusing and cumbersome. What frustrated her most was the delays, callous attitude of officials and constant demand of bribes. Her experience and the experience of many others like her has deterred people from taking up social service projects. A measure of Government control over voluntary social work is necessary. But it should not be exercised in a coercive or corrupt manner. What measures can you suggest to ensure that due control is exercised but well meaning, honest NGO efforts are not thwarted?

```ad-Answer

To ensure due control is exercised but well-meaning, honest NGO efforts are not thwarted, the following measures can be taken:

1.  Streamlining of the permission and approval process: The rules and procedures should be simplified and made more transparent to minimize confusion and delays. An online platform could be established for NGOs to apply for permission and track the status of their applications.
    
2.  Creation of a dedicated department: A dedicated department should be created within the government to handle the approval process for NGOs and to provide them with necessary support and guidance.
    
3.  Training for government officials: Officials handling NGO approvals should be trained on the importance of transparency and efficiency in their work. They should be made aware of the consequences of corrupt practices and the need to treat all NGOs fairly and equally.
    
4.  Implementation of a grievance redressal mechanism: An efficient grievance redressal mechanism should be in place to address complaints from NGOs regarding corrupt practices or delays in the approval process.
    
5.  Encouragement of Public-Private Partnerships: The government can encourage public-private partnerships between NGOs and private companies to provide funding and resources to these organizations.
    
6.  Leveraging government schemes: The government can leverage various existing schemes and programs to support the efforts of NGOs. For example, the 'CSR Funds' under the Companies Act, 2013 can be utilized to support the social initiatives of NGOs.
    
7.  Monitoring and Evaluation: Regular monitoring and evaluation should be conducted to ensure that the control measures are being implemented effectively and that the objectives of NGOs are being met.
    
8.  Promotion of transparency and accountability: The government should promote transparency and accountability in the functioning of NGOs. This can be achieved through regular financial audits, impact assessments, and mandatory reporting to the government.
    

By implementing these measures, the government can ensure that well-meaning, honest NGO efforts are not thwarted and that due control is exercised over the sector. At the same time, the efforts of NGOs in serving the society can be supported and encouraged, leading to the development and progress of the nation.
