Young people are the future of any society and they must play an active role in the political process of a country. Unfortunately, many young people in India are reluctant to come forward and join active politics due to their ethical conduct. This is a major obstacle to the development of the country. In order to motivate young people with ethical conduct to come forward and join active politics, it is important to create an environment that is conducive for them to participate.

Firstly, it is important to create awareness about the importance of active political participation among young people. This can be done through various mediums such as workshops, seminars, and campaigns. These activities should be organized in universities and colleges to create awareness about the importance of active political participation among young people. Additionally, the political parties should actively engage with the youth and create an environment that is conducive for them to actively participate in politics.

Secondly, it is important for the political parties to create a platform for young people to actively participate in politics. This can be done by introducing youth wings in the political parties and providing them with the necessary resources and support to engage in active political participation. Additionally, the political parties should create a system of accountability and ensure that the youth are given a chance to voice their opinions and ideas. This will create a sense of ownership among the youth and motivate them to come forward and join active politics.

Thirdly, it is important to create a culture of transparency and accountability in the political process. This can be done by introducing laws and regulations that promote transparency and accountability in the political process. Additionally, the political parties should ensure that the candidates they choose to contest elections have a good track record of ethical conduct. This will create an environment of trust and confidence among the youth and motivate them to come forward and join active politics.

Finally, it is important to create a system of rewards and recognition for young people who actively participate in politics. This can be done by introducing awards and scholarships for young people who actively participate in politics. Additionally, the political parties should provide financial assistance to young people who are actively involved in politics. This will create an environment of motivation and encourage young people with ethical conduct to come forward and join active politics.

Patriotism implies a deep love and devotion to one’s country and its citizens. It is a sense of pride and loyalty that goes beyond the boundaries of national borders and is present in both defense services and everyday civil life. In everyday civil life, patriotism is expressed through a variety of activities, such as voting in elections, participating in community events, and showing respect for the country’s flag and anthem.

For example, when you vote in an election, you are expressing your patriotism by exercising your right to choose the leaders of your country. This is an important way to show your support for the nation’s values and ideals. Similarly, participating in community events such as parades or festivals is another way to show your patriotism. These events are often organized to celebrate the nation’s accomplishments and to honor its citizens, and your participation is a way to show your support for the country.

In addition, displaying the national flag and singing the national anthem is a way to demonstrate patriotism in everyday life. The flag is a symbol of the nation’s unity and strength, and singing the anthem is a way to express pride and loyalty to the country. This is especially important during times of national crisis, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the nation needs to come together to overcome the challenges it faces.

Moreover, patriotism also implies a sense of responsibility to the nation. This means that citizens should be willing to work together to improve the country and its citizens’ lives. This can be done through volunteering in community projects, donating to charitable organizations, or even just helping out a neighbor in need. By doing so, citizens are showing their commitment to the nation and their dedication to making it better.

Finally, patriotism also implies a sense of unity among citizens. This means that citizens should be willing to work together to achieve common goals and to promote the nation’s values and ideals. This can be seen in the way citizens come together to celebrate their nation’s holidays or to support their country’s athletes in international competitions. By doing so, citizens are showing their commitment to the nation and their dedication to making it better.

1. It is often said that 'politics' and 'ethics' do not go together. What is your opinion in this regard? Justify your answer with illustrations. (प्रायः यह कहा जाता है कि ‘राजनीति’ और नैतिकता’ साथ-साथ नही चल सकते। इस ंसम्बन्ध में आपका क्या मत है? अपने उत्तर का, उदाहरणो सह ं ित, आधार बताइए। ) 2013

The relationship between politics and ethics is a complex one and is often seen as a dichotomy. On the one hand, politics is often seen as a pragmatic, rational, and instrumental activity, while ethics is seen as a moral, idealistic, and normative activity. On the other hand, there is a long-standing assumption that politics and ethics are incompatible. This assumption is often based on the idea that politics is driven by self-interest and is ultimately about power, while ethics is driven by altruism and is ultimately about justice.

Proponents of this dichotomy argue that politics is about the pursuit of self-interest, and thus it is incompatible with ethical behavior. They argue that politics is about power, and power is often used to manipulate and exploit others. Furthermore, they argue that politics is concerned with the “real world” and is thus not subject to moral considerations. As such, they argue that politics and ethics are fundamentally incompatible.

However, there are those who reject this dichotomy and argue that politics and ethics are not necessarily incompatible. They point out that politics can be used for the pursuit of justice, and that political power can be used to promote ethical behavior. For example, the laws enacted by governments can be used to protect the rights of citizens and to promote social justice. Furthermore, they argue that politics can be used to promote ethical behavior through the use of incentives and disincentives. For instance, governments can use taxes to encourage people to engage in socially beneficial activities, such as donating to charity.

**Social Influence and Persuasion**

1. How could social influence and persuasion contribute to the success of Swatchh Bharat Abhiyan? (सामाजिक प्रभाव और समझाना-बुझाना स्वच्छ भारत अभियान की सफलता के लिए किस प्रकार योगदान कर सकते हैं ?) 2016

```ad-Answer

Swatchh Bharat Abhiyan is an ambitious project launched by the Government of India in 2014 to make India clean and free of garbage. The campaign aims to create a clean and healthy environment by educating citizens about the importance of cleanliness and hygiene. Social influence and persuasion can play an important role in the success of this campaign.

Social influence is the process by which an individual’s attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are affected by the presence or actions of others. It is a powerful tool that can be used to influence people’s attitudes and behaviors towards a particular goal. In the case of Swatchh Bharat Abhiyan, social influence can be used to persuade people to participate in the campaign and take action to keep their surroundings clean.

Persuasion is another important tool that can be used to promote the campaign. It involves convincing people to adopt a particular attitude or behavior by providing them with compelling arguments and evidence. Through persuasive messages, people can be encouraged to take part in the campaign and make an effort to keep their environment clean.

The use of social media can also be beneficial in promoting the campaign. People can be encouraged to share information about the campaign on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This can help to create awareness about the campaign and motivate people to participate in it.

Celebrities can also be used to spread awareness about the campaign. They can be asked to post messages on social media platforms and participate in activities related to the campaign. This can help to create a buzz around the campaign and attract more people to take part in it.

In addition, the government can also organize events and activities to promote the campaign. This can include rallies, street plays, poster campaigns and other initiatives that can help to spread the message of cleanliness and motivate people to take part in the campaign.
