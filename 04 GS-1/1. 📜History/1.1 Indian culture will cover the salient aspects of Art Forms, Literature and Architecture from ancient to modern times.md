1. Discuss the significance of the lion and bull figures in Indian mythology, art and architecture. (भारतीय गमथिक कला और वास्तुकला में ससह एवं वृषभ की आकृ ं नतयो के महत्व पर ं नवचार करें।) 2022

```ad-Answer

The lion and bull are significant figures in Indian mythology, art, and architecture. In Hinduism, the lion and bull are believed to be the vehicles (vahanas) of two of the major gods, respectively. The lion is the vehicle of Goddess Durga, also known as Shakti, who represents strength, power, and protection. The bull is the vehicle of Lord Shiva, who represents destruction and regeneration.

In art and architecture, the lion and bull figures are commonly found in sculptures and carvings. For instance, the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath, a prominent example of Mauryan art, features four lions at the top of the pillar, representing the ideals of dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. Similarly, the bull is a common motif in the architecture of Hindu temples, especially those dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Nandi bull, which is often depicted as sitting in front of Shiva's linga, symbolizes strength, stability, and devotion.

The lion and bull figures also hold significance beyond their roles as vahanas in Hindu mythology. For instance, the Ashtamangala, a set of eight auspicious symbols in Buddhism, includes the lion and the bull. In Buddhism, the lion represents the Buddha's teachings, while the bull symbolizes the Buddha's first sermon at Sarnath.

```ad-Answer

Some ways in which Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu re-oriented the Bhakti movement are:

1.  Emphasis on devotion to Krishna: Sri Chaitanya emphasized the worship and devotion to Lord Krishna as the supreme deity, which was a departure from earlier Bhakti traditions that worshipped various gods and goddesses. This focus on Krishna bhakti became a hallmark of the Bhakti movement in the centuries that followed.
    
2.  Promotion of kirtan: Sri Chaitanya was known for his love of kirtan, which is a devotional practice that involves singing and chanting the names of God. He popularized this practice as a means of connecting with the divine and spreading the message of Bhakti to the masses.
    
3.  Universalism: Sri Chaitanya's teachings emphasized the universality of the Bhakti path, which meant that it was open to people of all castes and creeds. This was a radical departure from the rigid social hierarchy of the time and helped to democratize the Bhakti movement.
    
4.  Syncretism: Sri Chaitanya's teachings were a synthesis of various Bhakti traditions and also incorporated elements of Vaishnavism and other Hindu sects. This syncretic approach helped to bring together different strands of the Bhakti movement and create a more cohesive and unified movement.

1. How do you justify the view that the level of excellence of Gupta numismatic art is not at all noticeable in later times? (आप इस नवचार को, हक गुप्तकालीन ससक्ािास्तीय कला की उत्ृ टिता का स्तर बाद के समय में ननतांत दि्भनीय नही है, ं हकस प्कार सही ससधि करेंगे ?) 2017

```ad-Answer

reasons why the level of excellence of Gupta numismatic art is not noticeable in later times are:

1.  Decline of the Gupta Empire: The Gupta Empire declined after the 6th century AD, and this decline was accompanied by a gradual deterioration in the quality of numismatic art produced by subsequent rulers. The later coins lacked the finesse and detail of the earlier Gupta coins.
    
2.  Foreign invasions: India was invaded by several foreign powers in the centuries following the Gupta period, and this had a profound impact on the country's art and culture. The foreign rulers often introduced their own artistic styles and techniques, which displaced traditional Indian styles, including Gupta numismatic art.
    
3.  Economic factors: The quality of numismatic art produced by a civilization is often closely linked to its economic prosperity. The Gupta Empire was known for its economic prosperity, which allowed it to invest in high-quality art and craftsmanship. In later times, India faced numerous economic challenges, which may have contributed to a decline in the quality of numismatic art.
    
4.  Changing artistic tastes: Artistic styles and tastes change over time, and what may have been considered excellent art in one period may not be so in another. As Indian society and culture evolved in the centuries following the Gupta period, so too did artistic styles and preferences, which may have contributed to a decline in the quality of numismatic art.

1.  Depictions of Jataka Tales: Many early Buddhist stupas and sculptures depicted scenes from the Jataka Tales, which are stories about the previous lives of the Buddha. These tales often featured folk motifs and narratives, but also taught important Buddhist lessons about compassion, morality, and enlightenment.
    
2.  Symbolism: Early Buddhist art made use of a variety of symbols to convey important Buddhist concepts. For example, the Wheel of Life, or Bhavacakra, was a common symbol used to represent the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth in Buddhism.
    
3.  Mudras: Mudras, or hand gestures, were another important feature of early Buddhist art. These gestures were used to convey important Buddhist concepts and ideals, such as compassion, wisdom, and protection.
    
4.  Architecture: The design of early Buddhist stupas was also significant, as it often incorporated Buddhist ideals and concepts. For example, the shape of the stupa itself was said to represent the Buddha's body, while the various levels of the stupa symbolized different stages of spiritual attainment.

One of the significant reasons for this preservation of culture is the continuous evolution and adaptation of the Indian society to new changes while keeping its roots intact. For instance, the practice of yoga, Ayurveda, music, dance, and other cultural traditions is still prevalent today. The Hindu religion, which is one of the oldest surviving religions in the world, also has its roots in the ancient Indian civilization.

Moreover, the Indian culture and traditions were sustained through the ages due to the strong influence of religion and spirituality. The emphasis on the preservation of ancient texts and the tradition of oral transmission helped in safeguarding the culture from getting lost in the chaos of time. Examples of such texts include the Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and Epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana, which are still revered and followed today.

Mesolithic rock art in India is indeed a rich source of information about the cultural life of the times, including hunting, gathering, and early agriculture. These paintings and engravings on rocks depict animals, humans, and various objects, providing insights into the lifestyle and beliefs of the people of that era. Moreover, the artists of that time also exhibited a fine aesthetic sense in their depictions, which can be compared to modern painting in terms of their creativity, artistic expression, and use of color and form.

Examples of Mesolithic rock art in India include the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh, which have over 700 rock art sites dating back to 10,000 BCE to 2000 BCE. The paintings and engravings in Bhimbetka depict scenes from daily life, including hunting, dancing, and childbirth, as well as abstract symbols and designs.

Another example is the rock art in the Kaimur district of Bihar, which has paintings of animals like tigers, elephants, and rhinoceroses, as well as depictions of human figures in hunting scenes.

1. Gandhara sculpture owed as much to the Romans as to the Greeks. Explain. (गांधार मूर्तकला रोमननवाससयों की उतनी ही ऋणी थिी जजतनी हक वह यूनाननयो की ं थिी। स्पटि कीजजए।) 2014

```ad-Answer

Some of the features of Roman art that can be seen in Gandhara sculpture include the use of drapery to create a realistic effect, the representation of the human body in a naturalistic way, and the use of perspective in the composition of the artwork. These features can be seen in the Hellenistic and Roman sculptures, which were present in the region and served as models for the Gandharan artists.

For example, the Gandhara Buddha images have a distinctly Roman style, with the use of drapery to create a realistic effect and the depiction of the Buddha's body in a naturalistic way. The drapery in the Gandhara Buddha images is similar to the drapery in the Roman sculptures of the same period. Similarly, the facial features of the figures in the Gandhara sculptures have a Roman influence, with the depiction of prominent noses and deep-set eyes.

In addition, some of the motifs and symbols used in Gandhara art, such as the wreath and the laurel, were also borrowed from the Roman tradition. This can be seen in the sculptures of the Buddha, where he is often depicted wearing a wreath or a crown of leaves, which is a Roman motif.

Taxila was not a university in the modern sense because it did not have a centralized administration, a fixed curriculum, or an organized system of accreditation. However, it was a center of advanced learning where students from different parts of the world came to study under the guidance of famous teachers.

The fame of Taxila was mainly due to its strategic location at the crossroads of the ancient trade routes of the Indian subcontinent, which brought in scholars and students from different parts of the world. The scholars and students who came to Taxila were from diverse backgrounds and cultures, which contributed to the intellectual and cultural vibrancy of the city.

In contrast, Nalanda, another ancient Indian center of learning, was more like a modern university with a centralized administration, a fixed curriculum, and a system of accreditation. Nalanda had separate departments for different disciplines, and its teachers were highly respected authorities in their respective fields.

Sufis and medieval mystic saints did not bring any significant changes to the religious ideas and practices or the outward structure of Hindu/Muslim societies. While their message of love, peace, and devotion resonated with many, they were limited by the conservative nature of society and the entrenched power structures. For example, the Chishti order of Sufism emphasized the unity of all religions and the importance of love and service to humanity, but it did not challenge the caste system or patriarchy. Similarly, Kabir, a medieval mystic saint, preached a message of love and harmony between Hindus and Muslims, but his teachings did not significantly alter the social and religious practices of his time.
