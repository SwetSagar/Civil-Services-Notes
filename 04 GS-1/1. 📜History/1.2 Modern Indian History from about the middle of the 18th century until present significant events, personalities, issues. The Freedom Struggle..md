1. Why was there a sudden spurt in famines in colonial India since the mid-eighteenth century ? Give reasons. (औपननवेशिक भारत की अठारहवीं िताबी के मध् से क्ो अकाल प ं डने में अचानक वृगधि देखने को गमलती है? कारण बताएं।) 2022

```ad-Answer

The mid-eighteenth century saw a sudden spurt in famines in colonial India due to a number of factors. Historian David Arnold has argued that “the increasing impact of colonial rule and the changes it brought in the agrarian and commercial structure of Indian society, combined with a series of bad harvests, caused a series of famines of unprecedented severity.” 

The introduction of new taxation systems, especially the Permanent Settlement in Bengal, led to a significant shift in the agrarian structure of India. This resulted in a decrease in the amount of land available for cultivation, a rise in land rents and a decrease in the number of people employed in the agricultural sector. This created a situation of food insecurity, as people were unable to produce enough food to meet their needs.

Furthermore, the colonial government’s policies of free trade and laissez-faire economics resulted in a decrease in the price of food grains, leading to a decrease in the income of farmers. This further exacerbated the situation of food insecurity.

Additionally, colonial policies of land alienation and the displacement of peasants from their lands led to a decrease in the amount of land available for cultivation. This further reduced the amount of food that could be produced, leading to a situation of food insecurity and famine.

Data from the British government shows that between 1770 and 1866, there were at least twenty-four major famines in India, killing around 10 million people. This illustrates the severity of the famines and the extent of the food insecurity in colonial India. 

Various other reasons for famines were : 

1.  Natural Disasters: Drought, floods and other natural disasters have been a major cause of famines in colonial India, leading to crop failures and food shortages.
    
2.  Exploitative Economic Policies: The British colonial government implemented economic policies that drained resources from India, leading to poverty and food insecurity. This included the forced cultivation of cash crops for export, which depleted the food supply, and the introduction of the salt tax, which increased the cost of food.
    
3.  Deforestation and Land Degradation: Deforestation and land degradation in India during colonial times contributed to famines by reducing the availability of fertile land for agriculture. 
    
4.  Lack of Government Intervention: The colonial government often failed to provide adequate relief during famines, either because of a lack of resources or because of a belief that famine was a natural occurrence that should be left to run its course.
    
5.  Transportation Disruptions: Famines were often exacerbated by disruptions in transportation, such as railway strikes or blockades, which prevented food from reaching areas in need. This led to food shortages and skyrocketing food prices, making it difficult for poor people to afford enough to eat.

In conclusion, the mid-eighteenth century saw a sudden spurt in famines in colonial India due to the introduction of new taxation systems, the implementation of free trade policies, land alienation and displacement of peasants, and a series of bad harvests. These factors combined to create a situation of food insecurity and led to the death of millions of people.

10.  Psychological Warfare: The British employed psychological warfare techniques, such as using their red coats and bugle calls to intimidate their enemies, which had a demoralizing effect on the Indian armies.
    

Examples: The Battle of Plassey in 1757, the Battle of Buxar in 1764, and the First Anglo-Maratha War of 1775-1782 are a few examples of the victories of the British East India Company against the Indian rulers.

1. Trace the rise and growth of socio-religious reform movements with special reference to Young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj. (यंग बं गाल एवं ब्रह्ो समाज के नविेष सं दभ्भ में सामाजजक-धार्मक सुधार आन्ोलनो के उत् ं ान तथिा नवकास को रेखांहकत कीजजए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

The socio-religious reform movements of India were a result of the growing awareness among the people of their rights and a desire for a better future. These movements sought to bring about social and religious reforms in the Indian society. The reform movements of the 19th century were mainly led by the educated middle class and aimed to bring about a social revolution. The most prominent among these were the Young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj movements.

The Young Bengal movement was started by Henry Vivian Derozio in the early 19th century. He was a teacher at the Hindu College in Calcutta and was the first to introduce western ideas of free thought and rationalism in the Indian education system. He encouraged his students to think freely and question the existing social norms and practices. He also advocated for the rights of women and the lower castes. This movement was a radical departure from the traditional Indian thought and it was met with a lot of resistance from the conservative sections of society.

The Brahmo Samaj movement was founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1828. Roy was a strong advocate of the modernisation of Indian society and he sought to bring about social reforms in the country. He was a staunch believer of monotheism and sought to bring about reforms in the Indian religious practices. He was also a strong advocate of women’s rights and sought to abolish the practice of Sati. He was also a proponent of modern education and sought to bring about reforms in the Indian education system.

The Young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj movements had a profound impact on Indian society. They sought to bring about social and religious reforms in the country and were successful in their efforts. They helped to bring about a new wave of liberalism and modernity in the Indian society. They also helped to bring about a new awareness among the people of their rights and a desire for a better future.

The Young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj movements were instrumental in bringing about social and religious reforms in the Indian society. As Raja Ram Mohan Roy said, “The essence of true religion is to be found in the recognition of the unity of God, the brotherhood of man, and the fatherhood of God.” These movements helped to bring about a new wave of liberalism and modernity in the Indian society and helped to create a better future for the people.

1. To what extent did the role of the Moderates prepare a base for the wider freedom movement? Comment. (नरमपंसथियो की भू ं गमका ने हकस सीमा तक व्यापक स्तंत्रता आंदोलन का आधार तैयार हकया? हिपण्ी कीजजए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

The moderates were a group of Indian Nationalists who were active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were characterized by their belief in the use of constitutional methods, such as petitions, deputations, and negotiations with the British, to achieve political goals. They were generally opposed to the use of violence or militant tactics, which were embraced by the extremists of the era.

The most prominent moderates included Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Pherozeshah Mehta, and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. These leaders were all members of the Indian National Congress, which was established in 1885. They sought to reform the colonial system and improve the lives of Indians through political means.

Naoroji, for example, was a prominent figure in the Indian National Congress and was the first Indian Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons. He argued for Indian self-rule and for the protection of Indian workers in the British Empire. Gokhale was another leader of the Indian National Congress who advocated for social and economic reform. He was a mentor to Mahatma Gandhi and was instrumental in the formation of the Servants of India Society in 1905.

Tilak was also a prominent moderate leader. He was initially an extremist, but later shifted to a more moderate stance. He used the press to spread his ideas, and was a major advocate of swaraj (self-rule). He was imprisoned several times by the British for his activities.

The moderates used a variety of tactics to pressure the British government. They organized petitions, held public meetings, and published articles in the press. They also used negotiations to try to achieve their goals. Ultimately, their efforts helped to lay the groundwork for the more militant tactics later adopted by the Indian National Congress and other nationalist groups.

How Moderates provided a base for wider freedom movements : 

1.  Ideological Foundation: The Moderates provided the ideological foundation for the wider freedom movement by advocating for constitutional and parliamentary reform within the framework of British rule. This was significantly away from the liberal thought that was led by leaders like Surendranath Banerjea.

4.  Education and Awareness: The Moderates played a key role in educating and raising awareness among the Indian masses about political and social issues, paving the way for wider public involvement in the freedom movement. They brought about various newspapers like Rast Goftar, Kesari and Mahrattha, Hitvada etc.
    
5.  Representation of Indian Interests: The Moderates represented Indian interests in negotiations with the British government and helped to bring about some political concessions, such as the Indian Councils Act of 1909. 
    
6.  Creation of Nationalistic Sentiment: The Moderates helped to create a sense of nationalistic sentiment among Indians, laying the groundwork for the later demand for independence. 
    
7.  Development of Political Institutions: The Moderates played a key role in the development of political institutions in India, such as the Indian National Congress, which would later become the centerpiece of the freedom movement.
    
8.  Support for Local Movements: The Moderates supported and gave momentum to local movements, such as the Non-Cooperation Movement, which helped to build the wider national freedom struggle.
    
9.  Bridge between British and Indian Elites: The Moderates served as a bridge between British and Indian elites, helping to foster greater understanding and cooperation between the two sides.
    
10.  Legacy of Non-Violence: The Moderates left behind a legacy of non-violent resistance, which would later be adopted and popularized by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi. Their strong disapproval of Revolutionary terrorism limited govt militaristic response against them created a non-violence base to achieve freedom.

1. Evaluate the policies of Lord Curzon and their long term implications on the national movement. (लाड्भ कज्भन की नीनतयो एवं रा ं टिट्ीय आंदोलन पर उनके दूरगामी प्भावो का मूल ं ांकन कीजजए।) 2020

```ad-Answer

Lord Curzon was the Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905. He is known for his modernizing reforms and for his authoritarian attitude. He is also remembered for his aggressive policy towards the Indian National Movement. His policies had both positive and negative implications on the national movement.

One of the most important policies of Lord Curzon was the partition of Bengal in 1905. This was done to weaken the Bengali nationalist movement, which was growing in strength. The partition was seen as a deliberate attempt to divide the Bengali people and weaken their political power. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it sparked off a period of intense political agitation, leading to the formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885.

Another important policy of Lord Curzon was the introduction of the Indian Councils Act of 1909. This Act gave Indians greater representation in the government, but it also increased the powers of the Viceroy, making him virtually unaccountable to the Indian people. This policy had both positive and negative implications on the national movement. On the one hand, it gave Indians greater representation in the government and allowed them to voice their grievances to the Viceroy. On the other hand, it increased the power of the Viceroy and made it difficult for Indians to challenge his decisions.

Lord Curzon also introduced the Universities Act of 1904, which allowed the government to control the syllabus and the appointment of professors in universities. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it restricted the freedom of expression and the spread of nationalist ideas in educational institutions.

Lord Curzon also introduced the Police Act of 1902, based on the Fraser committee report, which gave the police greater powers to suppress dissent and protest. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it made it more difficult for Indians to organize protests and voice their grievances.

Lord Curzon also introduced the Indian Antiquities Act of 1904, which gave the government the power to control the excavation and preservation of ancient monuments. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it restricted the freedom of expression and made it difficult for Indians to preserve their cultural heritage. 

Lord Curzon also introduced the Official Secrets Act of 1904, which gave the government the power to prosecute anyone who leaked official information.Punishments under the Act range from three years to life imprisonment. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it made it difficult for nationalists to access information and organize protests.

Lord Curzon also implemented various policies that aimed to improve the living conditions of Indian society, however, many of these policies were controversial. He introduced the Plague Code that aimed to tackle the spread of the bubonic plague but it was heavily criticized as it violated people's civil liberties. Additionally, his policies on education were aimed at promoting Western education in India, which was seen as an attempt to Anglicize Indian society.

In conclusion, Lord Curzon's policies had both positive and negative implications on the national movement. His policies of partitioning Bengal, introducing the Indian Councils Act, the Universities Act, the Police Act, the Press Act, the Indian Antiquities Act and the Official Secrets Act had a long-term impact on the national movement, as they restricted the freedom of expression, weakened the political power of the people and made it difficult for Indians to access information and organize protests.

Further more, the long-term implications of Lord Curzon's policies on the national movement were significant. His policies fueled anti-British sentiment in India and gave rise to a more organized and unified national movement. The partition of Bengal in 1905, in particular, galvanized Indian public opinion and led to the growth of the national movement. Additionally, his policies on education, religion, and culture inspired Indian intellectuals to reclaim their cultural heritage and resist British cultural domination.

```ad-Answer


The Indian national movement, which was aimed at gaining independence from British rule, was shaped by various ideological strands. Here are some of the most prominent ones:

1.  Liberal Nationalism: This ideology was based on the idea of constitutionalism and representative government. It was championed by the moderate leaders of the Indian National Congress, who believed in using constitutional means, such as negotiations and petitioning, to achieve independence. 
	- Ex the idea of swaraj or self-rule. This was articulated by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, who argued that India should be governed by Indians, without the interference of the British. This idea of self-rule was further developed by leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, who sought to establish a secular, democratic republic in India.
    
2.  Socialism: This ideology was based on the idea of equality and the redistribution of wealth and resources. It was adopted by a section of the Indian National Congress, who believed in using socialist principles to address the social and economic problems of India.
    
3.  Hindu Nationalism: This ideology was based on the idea of Hindu cultural and religious nationalism. It was championed by the Hindu nationalist organizations, such as the Hindu Mahasabha, who believed in the primacy of Hindu culture and religion in India.
	- For example, the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha sought to mobilize the Hindu community
    
4.  Islamic Nationalism and Pan Islamism : This ideology was based on the idea of Islamic cultural and religious nationalism. It was championed by Muslim nationalist organizations, such as the All India Muslim League, who believed in the primacy of Islamic culture and religion in India. 
	- It also acquired a social strand in the form of the Khilafat movement. This movement was launched to protest the British treatment of the Ottoman Empire and the Caliph of Islam. The Khilafat movement sought to unite Hindus and Muslims in a common cause and to promote communal harmony.
    
5.  National-Populism: This ideology was based on the idea of mass mobilization and the empowerment of the common people. It was adopted by the leaders of the Indian National Congress, who believed in using mass mobilization and public opinion to achieve independence.
    
6.  Gandhian Nonviolence or Gandhian Nationalism : This ideology was based on the idea of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. It was championed by Mahatma Gandhi, who believed in using nonviolence as a means of resistance against British rule.
	- Ex the Satyagraha movement. This movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi to promote non-violent resistance to British rule. This movement was based on the principles of ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (truth-force).

7. Feminism : The expansion of the national movement’s social base was also achieved through the efforts of various women’s organizations. These organizations sought to mobilize women in the struggle for independence. For example, the All India Women’s Conference sought to promote the rights of women and to empower them to participate in the national movement.

2.  Sanyasi Rebellion (1773-1775): A revolt led by Hindu ascetics against British rule in Bengal and the east of India.
    
3.  Muddupalani's Revolt (1796): A rebellion led by a poet and courtesan named Rani Muddupalani against the British in Madras.
    
4.  Bhils Uprising (1817-1818): A rebellion led by the Bhil tribe in present-day Madhya Pradesh against British rule and the exploitation of the local population.

10.  Faraizi Movement (1820-1880): A religious and political movement led by Haji Shariatullah in Bengal that aimed to challenge British rule and promote Islamic reforms.

The various pre-1857 rebellions and uprisings in India were important in fueling public anger and discontent towards British rule. These rebellions highlighted the exploitation and oppression of the local population by the British and their Indian allies, and helped to build a sense of solidarity and resistance against colonial rule.

For example, the Santhal Rebellion and the Bhils Uprising brought attention to the plight of tribal communities who were being exploited and oppressed by the British and their allies. The Indigo Revolt and the Faraizi Movement drew attention to the economic exploitation of Indian peasants and the suppression of religious and cultural rights, respectively.

The widespread suffering and resentment caused by these rebellions helped to build a sense of anger and frustration among the Indian people, and provided the backdrop for the 1857 Mutiny. The Mutiny was not just a military uprising, but also a popular uprising that reflected the deep-seated discontent and anger of the Indian people towards British rule.

The Indian Renaissance of the 19th century was a period of cultural, social and political reform in India, marked by a resurgence of Indian intellectualism, cultural expression and national consciousness. It was a period of questioning and challenging the status quo, of breaking down existing social and political hierarchies, of questioning and re-evaluating the traditional values and beliefs of Indian society. The Indian Renaissance was a period of great creativity and intellectual ferment, which saw the emergence of many influential figures and movements.

The Indian Renaissance had a significant impact on the emergence of a national identity in India. It was a period in which Indian intellectuals and reformers began to articulate a shared identity and sense of belonging among the people of India. The Indian Renaissance saw the rise of a new generation of Indian thinkers and activists who sought to challenge the existing social and political structures of the British Raj. These activists and intellectuals began to articulate a vision of an independent India, one that was free from colonial rule and united under a single national identity. This vision of a unified Indian nation was a major factor in the emergence of a national identity in India.

The Indian Renaissance also saw the emergence of new forms of cultural expression and political organization. Indian intellectuals and activists began to articulate a shared sense of identity and pride in Indian culture and history. They sought to revive and promote Indian traditions and values, and to create a unified Indian identity that transcended regional and religious divisions. This shared sense of identity was a major factor in the emergence of a national identity in India.

Finally, the Indian Renaissance saw the rise of a new generation of political activists who sought to challenge the existing social and political structures of the British Raj. These activists sought to create a unified political voice for the people of India, and to fight for independence from colonial rule. This struggle for independence was a major factor in the emergence of a national identity in India, as it provided a platform for Indians to unite and fight for their common cause.

1. Clarify how mid-eighteenth century India was beset with the spectre of a fragmented polity. (सुस्पटि कीजजए हक मध्-अठारहवीं िताबी का भारत नवखं हडत राज्यतंत्र की छाया से हकस प्कार ग्रससत थिा।) 2017

```ad-Answer

The mid-eighteenth century in India was a period of political fragmentation, as the Mughal Empire had all but collapsed and the country was beset with a multitude of regional powers. This fragmentation was caused by a variety of factors, including the weakening of central authority, the rise of regional powers, and the emergence of new religious and political ideologies.

The weakening of Mughal central authority was the primary cause of India’s political fragmentation in the mid-eighteenth century. The Mughal Empire had been in decline since the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, and by the mid-eighteenth century, it had become a loose confederacy of states. As the Mughal Empire weakened, regional powers began to emerge. These powers included the Marathas, the Rajputs, the Sikhs, and the British East India Company. These regional powers began to challenge the authority of the Mughal Empire and carve out their own independent territories.

The rise of regional powers was another factor in India’s political fragmentation in the mid-eighteenth century. The Marathas, Rajputs, Sikhs, and British East India Company all sought to expand their power and influence. The Marathas, for example, were able to expand their control over much of the Deccan region, while the Rajputs were able to carve out their own independent states in Rajasthan. The Sikhs also established their own independent kingdom in the Punjab, while the British East India Company was able to gain control of large parts of India.

The emergence of new religious and political ideologies was another factor in India’s political fragmentation in the mid-eighteenth century. The rise of Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism challenged the Islamic ideology of the Mughal Empire and further weakened its authority. The Hindu Marathas, in particular, sought to expand their power and influence and challenge the Mughal Empire. The Sikh Khalsa movement also sought to establish an independent Sikh state in the Punjab.

The political fragmentation of India in the mid-eighteenth century had far-reaching consequences. It led to a period of political instability and conflict, as the various regional powers sought to expand their power and influence. It also led to the emergence of new political ideologies and the weakening of the Mughal Empire. This period of political fragmentation ultimately paved the way for the emergence of the British Empire in India.

```ad-Answer

The failure of the ‘Moderates’ to carry conviction with the nation about their proclaimed ideology and political goals by the end of the nineteenth century can be attributed to a number of factors. Primarily, the ‘Moderates’ were unable to gain the support of the majority of the Indian population due to their lack of commitment to the cause of Indian independence. Despite their claims to be the ‘true nationalists’, they were unwilling to take any concrete steps towards achieving independence. As the Indian National Congress leader, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, lamented, “The Moderates have failed to move the nation.”

The Moderates’ approach to the Indian independence movement was largely characterized by caution and compromise. They believed in working within the existing British colonial system to gradually achieve their goals. This approach was seen as too incremental by many in the Indian population, who were increasingly demanding more radical action. As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, “The Moderates have failed to move the nation because they have not been bold enough in their demands.”

The Moderates’ insistence on non-violence and peaceful protest also failed to inspire the nation. While this approach had been effective in some cases, such as the Indian boycott of British goods, it was seen by many as too passive. The rise of the more radical Indian Nationalists, who advocated for more direct action, such as the use of armed struggle, further undermined the Moderates’ position.

The Moderates’ lack of commitment to the cause of Indian independence was also a major factor in their failure. While they were willing to make some concessions to the British, such as the acceptance of some forms of indirect rule, they were unwilling to push for full independence. This caused them to lose the support of the more radical elements of the Indian population, who viewed them as too conciliatory.

Finally, the Moderates’ failure to address the social and economic issues facing the Indian population also contributed to their downfall. While they had some limited success in achieving certain reforms, such as the repeal of certain discriminatory laws, they failed to address the root causes of poverty and inequality. This caused them to lose the support of the majority of the Indian population, who were increasingly disillusioned with their lack of progress.

In conclusion, the failure of the ‘Moderates’ to carry conviction with the nation about their proclaimed ideology and political goals by the end of the nineteenth century was due to their lack of commitment to the cause of Indian independence, their insistence on non-violent protest and their failure to address the social and economic issues facing the Indian population.

1. Examine how the decline of traditional artisanal industry in colonial India crippled the rural economy.(परीक्ण कीजजए हक औपननवेशिक भारत में पारम्पररक कारीगरी उद्योग के पतन ने हकस प्कार ग्रामीण अथि्भव्यवस्ा को अपंग बना हदया।)
2017

```ad-Answer



In traditional colonial India, artisanal industries were a major provider of income, employment and goods to rural areas. These industries included weaving, pottery, metalworking, carpentry and stonemasonry. Artisans were highly skilled and used local resources to craft goods that were of high quality and provided a livelihood to many rural people. 

The decline of traditional artisanal industry in colonial India crippled the rural economy in numerous ways. Firstly, the British Raj implemented policies that sought to de-emphasize the importance of artisanal industries. These included the introduction of tariffs, which made imported British products cheaper and put local artisans at a disadvantage. On top of this, the Raj implemented a series of land reforms which resulted in rural artisans losing much of their land. This had a devastating effect on the rural economy, as it meant that artisans could no longer produce the goods they needed to sustain themselves. 

The decline of traditional artisanal industry also resulted in a loss of employment opportunities for rural people. The lack of demand for artisanal goods meant that many artisans were either forced out of work or had to find other employment. This had a knock-on effect, as it led to an increase in poverty and social unrest in the countryside.

The economic effects of the decline of traditional artisanal industry in colonial India have been long-lasting. The country has failed to regain the levels of economic activity in rural areas that existed prior to British rule. This has had a significant impact on the rural economy, as many of the opportunities for income and employment that existed when artisanal industries were flourishing have disappeared.

```ad-Answer

The Uprising of 1857 was a seminal event in the history of British rule in India. It was a widespread revolt against British rule, fueled by grievances over taxation and land rights, as well as resentment of British cultural and religious interference. The Uprising demonstrated the strength of anti-colonial sentiment amongst Indians and forced the British to modify their colonial policies in India. The Uprising resulted in a shift from a policy of direct rule to one of indirect rule. Subsequent reforms, such as the Indian Councils Act of 1861, granted Indians greater representation in local and regional government, thus increasing their political autonomy. The British also abolished the East India Company and took direct control of the Indian subcontinent. In addition, the British began to implement tax and land reforms in the interests of the Indian population. The Uprising of 1857 thus marked a significant watershed in the evolution of British policies towards colonial India, as the British government developed a new approach to colonial rule in response to the uprising.

During the Gandhian phase of the Indian independence struggle, the role of women was critical and full of courage, dedication, and commitment. Women were at the forefront of the movement, taking part in the civil disobedience movement and the freedom struggle organised by Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. They actively participated in protest marches, demonstrations, boycotts, and picketing of shops. Women like Aruna Asaf Ali, Sucheta Kripalani, and Usha Mehta played a key role in the underground movement against the British.

Women also contributed significantly to the Quit India Movement and the Civil Disobedience Movement. They organised and took part in demonstrations, rallies and marched alongside men to protest against the British. Women like Sarojini Naidu, Aruna Asaf Ali, and Usha Mehta formed the backbone of the movement and their courage, determination, and resilience inspired many others to join the struggle.

In addition to this, women also played a significant role and contributed to the development of India's cultural and literary landscape. Many women writers, poets, and activists took part in the freedom struggle and wrote extensively about the plight of women in India under British rule. They wrote about how women were affected by the economic and social inequalities created by the British and about how India needed to be liberated from British rule.

Thus, the role of women in the freedom struggle during the Gandhian phase was critical and their contribution was immense. Their courage, resilience, and determination inspired many and they ultimately became a driving force behind India's independence.

Without Mahatma Gandhi, Indian independence would likely have achieved in a different manner. The independence movement was marked by a number of leaders and groups, including the Indian National Congress, which was founded in 1885. However, it was only after Gandhi's return from South Africa in 1915, that the Congress took a more active role in the national struggle. Through peaceful civil disobedience, Gandhi was able to raise awareness and inspire people across the country to join the struggle. He was able to unite a wide variety of religious and ethnic groups under the banner of independence. His leadership and determination helped to galvanize the independence movement and ultimately lead to the achievement of Indian independence in 1947.

Without Gandhi, the independence movement would have likely been a much slower and more fragmented effort. Without his unifying leadership, the Indian National Congress may not have been as successful in organizing and mobilizing the people of India. It is possible that a number of different groups, with different ideologies and objectives, would have competed for leadership and taken the independence struggle in different directions. Additionally, without Gandhi's strong commitment to peaceful civil disobedience, the struggle for independence could have turned violent, resulting in much greater casualties and greater difficulty in achieving independence.

Overall, it is clear that without Mahatma Gandhi, the achievement of Indian independence would have been vastly different. His leadership, commitment to non-violence, and ability to unite the people of India were instrumental in achieving independence.

The city of Panipat, located in Haryana, India, held immense strategic significance in the past. It was located on the Grand Trunk Road, which connected the regions of the northwest, the Punjab, and Delhi. Panipat was also a gateway to the rich resources of the Ganges-Yamuna Doab. This, combined with its proximity to the capital of the Mughal Empire, made Panipat an ideal location for large-scale battles and campaigns. The Third Battle of Panipat was fought between the Marathas and the Afghan army led by Ahmad Shah Durrani. This battle effectively marked the end of the Maratha Empire and was one of the most significant battles in the history of India.

1. Examine critically the various facets of economic policies of the British in India from mideighteenth century till independence. (भारत में अठारहवीं िताबी के मध् से स्तंत्रता तक अंग्रेजी की आर्थिक नीनतयो के ं नवशभन्नmपक्ो का समालोचनात्मक परी ं क्ण कीजजए।) 2014

```ad-Answer

The British economic policies in India have been a subject of great controversy over the years. Many historians have argued that the British economic policies in India weakened the Indian economy and played a major role in its eventual subjugation.

The British began their rule in India as relatively hands-off rulers in the mid-eighteenth century. They were more interested in controlling and administering the country rather than developing its economic infrastructure. As a result, India’s economy stagnated under British rule. The British also imposed high taxes on raw materials, which put an immense strain on the agricultural sector.

In 1793, the British introduced the Permanent Settlement of Land Revenue, which took away the right of Indian princes to collect land tax and gave it to the British. This was a disastrous move, as it made the Indian princes and landlords dependent on the British for their income. This also caused a deep rift between the peasantry and the British.

The 19th century saw a major shift in the British economic policies in India. They began to pursue a policy of free trade and a hands-off approach to the Indian economy. This was beneficial to the British merchants and industrialists, who were able to take advantage of the low-cost labour and resources in India. However, this policy had disastrous consequences for Indian industry, which was unable to compete with the cheaper imports from Britain. This led to the deindustrialization of India.

The British also introduced a number of restrictive economic reforms, such as the salt tax and the opium trade, which caused immense suffering to the Indian people.

In conclusion, the British economic policies in India were largely exploitative and oppressive, and played a major role in the subjugation of the Indian people. The British policies weakened the Indian economy and caused immense suffering to the people. These policies are often cited as one of the primary reasons for India’s eventual independence.

Lord Dalhousie was a Scottish statesman who served as the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856. During his tenure, he introduced a number of major reforms and initiatives that laid the foundation for modern India.

He introduced the first modern railway system in India, linking Bombay to Thane, Calcutta to Delhi, and Madras to Arakonam. He also introduced telegraphy, postal systems, and irrigation works. He was responsible for the reorganization of the army, and he founded the Indian Engineering College at Roorkee.

Moreover, he was responsible for the Doctrine of Lapse, which allowed the British East India Company to annex any princely state in India that had no male heir. This resulted in the annexation of several princely states, including Satara, Nagpur, and Jhansi.

He was also responsible for the introduction of English as a medium of instruction in Indian universities and colleges. He also created a unified system of administration for all of India, which laid the groundwork for modern administration in the subcontinent.

Finally, Lord Dalhousie was responsible for the modernization of India's infrastructure and government. He improved the road and rail networks, introduced the use of steamboats, and established civil and military engineering schools. All of these reforms laid the foundation for modern India.

1. The political and administrative reorganization of states and territories has been a continuous ongoing process since the mid-nineteenth century. Discuss with examples. (राज्यो एवं ं प्देिो का ं राजनीनतक और प्िासननक पुनग्भठन उन्नीसवीं िताबी के मध् में ननरंतर चल रही एक प्हरिया है। उदाहरण सहहत नवचार करें।) 2022

```ad-Answer

The political and administrative reorganization of states and territories has been an ongoing process since the mid-nineteenth century. This process has been driven primarily by the need for efficiency and consolidation of resources. It has been used to both create and dissolve borders, define the scope of government functions, and foster economic development. 

One example of the reorganization of states and territories was the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed out of the former Russian Empire, a conglomerate of nations and states. The newly formed Union was divided into 15 republics, many of which had been organized from the former Russian Empire's constituent parts. This reorganization created a government structure with centralized control and resources, and laid the groundwork for a period of rapid economic development for the Union. 

The United States has also undergone several reorganizations of states and territories in the past two centuries. In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase saw the United States double in size, and the newly acquired territories were organized into the Louisiana Territory. In 1848, the Mexican-American War resulted in the acquisition of California and other territories, which were then organized into the New Mexico Territory. In 1959, the Alaska and Hawaii territories were admitted as the 49th and 50th states of the Union. 

These examples show how the political and administrative reorganization of states and territories has been used to both create and dissolve borders, define the scope of government functions, and foster economic development. As the world continues to evolve and change, it is likely that there will be more reorganization of states and territories in the future.

WRT India

The political and administrative reorganization of states and territories has been an ongoing process since the mid-nineteenth century. With the breakdown of the traditional political structures and the rise of nation-states, the process of state and territorial reorganization has played a critical role in the development of modern nation-states.

In India, the process of state and territorial reorganization began with the establishment of the Indian National Congress in 1885. This was followed by the formation of a Central Legislative Assembly in 1909 and an All-India legislative Council in 1919. In 1921, the British government created the Indian Statutory Commission to investigate the question of provincial autonomy, which ultimately led to the Government of India Act in 1935. This act allowed for the creation of new provinces and the reorganization of existing states and territories.

Since independence in 1947, India has continued to reorganize its states and territories. In 1956, the States Reorganization Act divided the country into the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. In 1966, the union of Punjab and Haryana was dissolved and the new states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Gujarat were formed. In 2000, the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) recommended further reorganization of state boundaries and local government structures.

In recent years, there have been increasing demands for the creation of new states in India. These demands have been led by various political and social movements, including the demand for a separate Telangana state in 2013, the Gorkhaland movement in West Bengal in 2017, and the demand for a separate state of Vidarbha in Maharashtra in 2018. Such demands have been met with mixed responses from the Indian government, with some demands being accepted while others have been rejected.

Overall, the process of political and administrative reorganization of states and territories has played an important role in the nation-building process in India. It has enabled the country to create unified states with stronger administrative and legislative power and has resulted in greater regional autonomy. However, it has also given rise to a number of regional conflicts and disputes as well.

1. Assess the main administrative issues and socio-cultural problems in the integration process of Indian Princely States. (150 words) (भारतीय ररयासतो के एकीकरण की ं प्हरिया में मुख् प्िासननक मुद्ो एवं सामाज ं जक-सांस्ृ नतक समस्ाओ का आकलन कीज ं जए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

The main administrative issues faced during the integration process of Indian Princely States were related to the massive logistical tasks associated with the transfer of power from the princely rulers to the Indian government. This included the setting up of new administrative structures, the transfer of government personnel, the setting up of new taxation systems, and the codification of laws. This was a huge undertaking and it took considerable time, money and effort for the government to successfully integrate the Princely States into the Indian union.

The socio-cultural problems faced during the integration process of Indian Princely States was rooted in the diverse culture and traditions of the different regions. In some cases, the princely rulers had resisted Indian rule and the local populace saw this as a threat to their autonomy. This led to a breakdown of trust and communication between the rulers and their people, and the feeling of being ‘invaded’ by the Indian government. Additionally, the local population were often not adequately prepared for the transition, as they had no access to information and were unfamiliar with the Indian laws and regulations. This created a sense of uncertainty and fear among the people which further hindered the integration process.

1. Critically discuss the objectives of Bhoodan and Gramdan movements initiated by Acharya
Vinoba Bhave and their success. (आचाय्भ नवनोबा भावे के भूदान व ग्रामदान आन्ोलनो के उद् ं ेश्यो की समालोचनात्मक ं नववेचना कीजजए और उनकी सफलता का आकलन कीजजए।) 2013

```ad-Answer

The Bhoodan and Gramdan movements initiated by Acharya Vinoba Bhave in 1951 were aimed at redistributing land from landlords to peasant farmers. The objective of the Bhoodan Movement was to encourage landowners to voluntarily donate land to landless farmers and to persuade the government to fund land redistribution programs. The objective of the Gramdan Movement was to promote the concept of village ownership, where all the villagers would own the land collectively and manage it themselves.

The Bhoodan Movement was initially successful in convincing some landholders to donate land to the landless farmers. In the first five years of the Bhoodan Movement, 3 million acres of land were donated by the landowners. However, there was significant criticism of the Bhoodan Movement in later years due to the lack of implementation of the land redistribution schemes. The government was reluctant to invest in land redistribution and the landowners were unwilling to donate more land than what was mandated by law.

The Gramdan Movement also faced similar criticism due to its lack of implementation. Although the concept of collective ownership of land was appealing to rural communities, there was no legal framework to enable Gramdan. As a result, the achievement of the objective of the Gramdan Movement was very limited.

Overall, the objectives of the Bhoodan and Gramdan movements initiated by Acharya Vinoba Bhave were noble and progressive, but their success was limited due to the lack of government support and the unwillingness of landowners to part with more land than what was mandated by law.

1. Analyze the circumstances that led to Tashkent Agreement in 1966. Discuss the highlights of the agreement. (उन पररस्स्नतयो का ं नवश्ेषण कीजजए जजनके कारण वष्भ 1966 में तािकं द समझौता हआ। समझौते की नवशिटिताओ की ं

```ad-Answer

The Tashkent Agreement was signed on 10 January 1966 between India and Pakistan in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The agreement was mediated by Soviet Union Premier Alexei Kosygin. The agreement was a result of the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War which lasted for 17 days and ended in a United Nations mandated ceasefire.

The war had broken out after Pakistans Operation Gibraltar which was launched to infiltrate the Indian part of Kashmir with the intension of sparking an uprising against the Indian rule. India retaliated by launching an attack on the West Pakistani side of Kashmir. In spite of initial success in the war, India was forced to pull back due to increasing pressure from the United Nations on both countries to end the hostilities.

The highlights of the Tashkent Agreement were:

• A mutual agreement to withdraw to pre-war boundaries and ceasing of all military activities between the two countries.
• Renunciation of the use or threat of force in the future.
• Establishment of diplomatic and trade relations.
• Pledging to refrain from interfering in each other’s internal affairs.
• Pakistan agreed to release all Indian prisoners of war.
• India and Pakistan agreed to set up a Joint Commission with India, Pakistan and the Soviet Union as members to consider and decide all unresolved issues between the two countries.
• India and Pakistan agreed to work for the promotion of peace and friendship between them.

The Tashkent Agreement was a short-term solution to the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War. In spite of the agreement, the tensions between the two countries have remained high due to longstanding issues such as the Kashmir conflict. The agreement, however, did set a precedent for future negotiations between India and Pakistan.

1. Critically examine the compulsions which prompted India to play a decisive roles in the
emergence of Bangladesh. ( उन पररस्स्नतयो का समालोचनात्मक परी ं क्ण कीजजए जजनके कारण भारत को बांग्ादेि के उदय में ननणा्भयक भूगमका का ननव्भहन करना पडा।) 2013

```ad-Answer

The emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation in 1971 was the result of a complex interplay of political, social and economic compulsions that prompted India to play a decisive role.

The pre-independence political landscape of Bangladesh had been marred by the oppressive rule of the West Pakistani establishment. The people of Bangladesh felt alienated from the mainstream politics of Pakistan and demanded greater autonomy. This was accompanied by the systematic oppression and discrimination perpetrated against the Bengalis in terms of unequal access to economic resources, educational opportunities and civil liberties. The economic disparity, the unceasing political oppression and the gross violation of human rights by the government of Pakistan further fuelled the Bengali independence movement.

India, which had been at the forefront of the struggle for independence, viewed the situation in Bangladesh as a humanitarian issue and a threat to regional and global stability. The India-Pakistan War of 1971 further escalated the situation and India decided to intervene militarily in order to protect the Bengali population from the brutality of the Pakistani forces. India provided political, military and diplomatic assistance to the forces fighting for the independence of Bangladesh. It provided refuge to millions of Bengali refugees who were fleeing the violence in East Pakistan. India also provided material and moral support to the Mukti Bahini, the guerrilla force fighting for the liberation of Bangladesh.

The Indian intervention was critical in bringing about the eventual birth of Bangladesh and its recognition as an independent nation by the international community. The Indian role was crucial in highlighting the need for self-determination of the Bengali people and in restoring dignity and freedom to them. Though India's intervention did not go down well with the international community, it was necessary in order to ensure justice and stability in the region.
