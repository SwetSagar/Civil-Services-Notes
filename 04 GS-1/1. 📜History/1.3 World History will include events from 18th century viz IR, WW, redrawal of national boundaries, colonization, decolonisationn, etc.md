1. “There arose a serious challenge to the Democratic State System between the two World

```ad-Answer

There was indeed a serious challenge to the Democratic State System between the two World Wars. This challenge was most notably seen in the rise of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes in Europe, such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, as well as in Japan and other countries around the world. These regimes sought to suppress democracy and impose their own ideals and policies, often through oppressive means. This period was marked by repression and violence, and it was a stark contrast to the democratic ideals of the period before the war. It also made it more difficult for democratic states to survive and thrive, as the authoritarian regimes sought to undermine their legitimacy. Ultimately, this challenge to the Democratic State System between the two World Wars led to its decline and the rise of authoritarianism and totalitarianism in many parts of the world.

1. Why indentured labour was taken by the British from India to other colonies? Have they been
able to preserve their cultural identity over there? (अंग्रेज़ हकस कारण भारत से करारबधि रिगमक अन् उपननवेिो में ले ं

```ad-Answer

Indentured labour was taken by the British from India to other colonies to provide much-needed cheap labour for their plantations, mines, construction sites and other industries. This labour was supposed to fill the gap for lost slave labour following the abolition of slavery in the British colonies. Indentured labourers were promised a return passage to India and other benefits such as food, housing, and medical care. However, the reality of their working conditions was often exploitative and brutal.

1. What problems were germane to the decolonization process of Malay Peninsula. (मलय प्ायद्ीप में
उपननवेिन उन्लन ू प्रिम में सनन्नहहत क्ा-क्ा समस्ाएँ थिी ?) ं 2017

```ad-Answer



1. Conflict between the newly independent states: After World War II, the Malay Peninsula was divided between the British and the Japanese, with British Malaya becoming independent in 1957, while the Japanese-controlled territories in the north of the peninsula formed the Federation of Malaya, which was then granted independence in 1957. This partition of the peninsula caused problems between the two newly independent states, with both sides claiming ownership of the same territory.

2. Ethnic conflict: The Malay Peninsula is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, including Malays, Chinese, Indian, and other ethnic minorities. During the decolonization process, tensions between these ethnic groups led to conflict, which in turn hindered the process of decolonization.

3. Nationalist movements: Nationalist movements in the Malay Peninsula were also a major issue during the decolonization process. These groups sought greater autonomy and independence for their respective territories, which led to disagreements and clashes between the different groups.

4. Colonial legacy: During the colonial period, the British implemented a divide and rule policy in the Malay Peninsula, which led to many socio-economic issues that remain to this day. These issues, such as income inequality, lack of economic development and access to education, have hindered the development of the region since independence.

```ad-Answer



The anti-colonial struggles in West Africa were led by a new elite of Western-educated Africans who sought to end the oppressive and exploitative rule of the European colonial powers. This new elite was composed of intellectuals, writers, and activists who had been exposed to the ideals of liberalism and modernity while studying abroad. They returned to their homelands with a clear purpose: to organize and lead a movement for national liberation and self-determination. The new African elite sought to create a new political order based on justice and progress while preserving traditional values and cultures. This new elite played a vital role in uniting their compatriots against the common enemy of colonialism, and their efforts often produced successful independence movements. Examples of this include the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons, the National Liberation Movement of Guinea-Bissau, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, and the United Party of Togo. These organizations and figures were crucial to the success of the anti-colonial struggle in West Africa, and their legacy continues to be felt today.

1. The industrial revolution first occurred in England due to its social, economic, and legal conditions. These conditions included an abundance of natural resources and a large population with the necessary skills to work in factories. England also had a stable government and well-developed financial institutions.

2. Life during the industrialization in England was not always easy, with factory workers having to work long hours in difficult and often dangerous conditions. Wages were typically low, and many people lived in cramped and unsanitary slums.

3. Quality of life in India at present is much better than it was during the Industrial Revolution in England. The majority of people enjoy better access to education, healthcare, and housing, and workers have access to more rights and protections.

1. To what extent can Germany be held responsible for causing the two World Wars? Discuss
critically. (हकस सीमा तक जम्भनी को दो नवश् युधिो का कारण बनने का ज ं जम्ेदार ठहराया जा सकता है? समालोचनात्मक चचा्भ कीजजए।) 2015

```ad-Answer



Germany can be held responsible for causing the two World Wars, but it cannot take all the blame. Both World Wars were a result of a complex set of factors and decisions made by a variety of countries. Germany had a significant role to play in the events of both wars, but that role was by no means the only contributing factor.

One of the key ways in which Germany can be held responsible for causing the two World Wars was its aggressive foreign policy in the early 20th century. The country was determined to expand its influence across Europe, and its militaristic approach to international relations stoked tensions between rival powers. Germany's annexation of Austria-Hungary in 1938 sparked the Second World War, as it left France and Britain feeling threatened and in need of a response. This was a major factor in the outbreak of the war, and Germany should be held accountable for it.

At the same time, it is important to consider the other contributing factors to the two World Wars. Germany's policy of aggressive expansion was a symptom of wider geopolitical tensions between the major European powers. This had been building for decades, and was only exacerbated by the rise of nationalist ideologies such as fascism and communism. Germany was not the only country to pursue expansionist policies, and so it cannot take all the blame for sparking the wars.

In conclusion, while Germany can certainly be held responsible for causing the two World Wars, it cannot take all the blame. A variety of other factors, such as the rise of nationalist ideologies, geopolitical tensions, and the decisions taken by other countries, also played a role.

1. What were the major political, economic and social developments in the world which motivated
the anti-colonial struggle in India? (नवश् में घहित कौन-सी मुख् राजनीनतक, आर्थिक और सामाजजक गनतनवधयो ने भारत में ं
उपननवेि-नवरोधी सं घष्भ को प्रे रत हकया?) 2014

```ad-Answer

India's anti-colonial struggle was motivated by a variety of political, economic, and social developments around the world. These developments were influenced by the motivations of European powers that colonized India and the rest of the world, as well as the global historical context of the time.

One major political development that motivated India's anti-colonial struggle was the rise of anti-colonial and nationalist movements in other parts of the world, such as in Africa and Southeast Asia. These movements sought to reclaim their sovereignty and independence from European powers, inspiring Indian nationalists to do the same. [[3](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/precontact-and-early-colonial-era/old-and-new-worlds-collide/a/motivations-for-conquest-of-the-new-world)]

Economically, the British colonial rule in India was marked by exploitative policies that led to poverty and economic hardship for many Indians. The Indian National Congress, one of the key organizations in the Indian independence movement, demanded economic reforms that would improve the lives of Indians and grant them greater economic autonomy. This included calls for greater Indian control over trade and industry, and for the end of British policies that favored British businesses over Indian ones. [[1](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/motivations-colonization/)]

Socially, the anti-colonial struggle in India was motivated by the desire to end the discriminatory policies of British colonial rule. This included calls for greater political representation for Indians, and an end to the British policy of divide and rule, which had pitted different religious and ethnic groups against each other. The Indian National Congress and other organizations also called for greater social reforms, such as the abolition of the caste system and the promotion of women's rights.
