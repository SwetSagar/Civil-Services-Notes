## Daylight Saving Time

- [Daylight saving time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRQcW9ODoP4) : 
	-Setting up of clock ahead or backwards to extend the daylight hours. This was done since it saves energy, completion of work earlier. But it has issues with increasing heart problems, spike in workplace injuries, on Agriculture and labour and productivity.

## Cyclones

- Frequency of very severe storms in Arabian Sea has increased due to inc is global temp/warming. Wind shear is driving cyclones from far areas towards Western Coast.
	- 52% inc in frequency of cyclones in Arabian Sea and 8% in BoB since 2000. Reasons : 1. Inc in surface temp -> more intensification of cyclonse due to inc convection. 2. Underlying features ex land sea boundary, bays, estuaries.

- **Bomb Cyclone** aka **Bombogenesis** or **Nor'easter** is a mid latitude cyclone that intensifies rapidly. It occurs when atmospheric pressure at the centre of the cyclone drops at least 24 milibars over 24 hrs.
	- Cold airs and fronts are an essential feature for bomb cyclones and are associated with blizzards.
	- It occurs in areas of northwest Atlantic, NW Pacific and sometimes the mediterranean sea from late winter to early spring.

- **Subdued cyclones** occur due to calm South China sea, weak La Nina. **Madden Julian Oscillation** has a -ve influence over cyclones, vertical wind shear ^59356a
- Hurricanes are measured by the **Saffir Simpson wind** scale.

## Heatwaves

- [[7. Heat Wave and Cold Wave#Cold Waves |Cold Wave]]
- **Marine heatwaves** are a coherent area of extreme warm sea surface temp that happen when sea temperatures are warmer than normal for extended period of time.
	- Ocean current cause inc in temp, weak winds does not remove heated water from ocean surface to move.
	- Western Indian ocean has seen largest inc in these waves.


## Volcanoes

- Pacific Ring of Fire was formed due ot subduction of oceanic tectonic plates beneath lighter contiental plates.
![[Pasted image 20220403012615.png]]
- Mt Sinabung Indonesia erupts, INDO has 127/400 active volcanos.

## Geomagnetic storms

- **Geomagnetic storms** are caused due to solar flares when they interact with Earths magnetic field. Solar coronal mass ejection CME or Co-rotating interaction region CIR are constituents of the storm.
	- G1 storms affects power grids causing weak fluctuations, minor impacts on satellite operation and northern and southern lights occur.
	- G 5 storm causes voltage problems, blackouts, radios are hindered.

## Solar Flares

- **Solar flares** could cause the visibility of Northern lights in areas of lower latitude. **Aurora** caused by collision of fast moving electron w/ oxygen/nitrogen molecule of Earth's upper atm.

## Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO

- **Pacific Decadal Oscillation(PDO)** : oceanic current located in pacific ocean duration is longer than ENSO (20-30 yrs), major effect in Alaskan weather and global temp, ==North East India rapidly drying due to it==.

## Ozone Hole

- Ozone hole is the smallest ever recorded this year since 1982. This was due to ==warm stratospheric temperatures== not because of dramatic recovery.

## El Nino, Climate Change and Monsoon

- Due to climate change : increased temp El Nino events are likely to become more frequent; the onset location has shifted from the eastern pacific to the western pacific causing frequent and extreme [El Nino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o) events
- **La Nina** this year has led to Northeast monsoon being subdued ^a 98 c 6b
- NE monsoon is a permanent feature occurs from October to December rains in TN, KTAKA, TEL, AP, KER is seen ^c72265
	- La Nina has a negative impact on it but a +ve on SE Monsoon.
- Effect of climate change on El Nino
	1. Inc CO2 will weaken future ENSO and surface temp variability.
	2. Will lose heat to atm more quickly
	3. Reduce temp difference b/w Easter and western tropical pacific -> inhibit dev of ENSO
	4. Tropical Instability waves will weaken and disrupt La Nina event.

## Polar Vortex 

- **Polar vortex** : low pressure whirling cone region in the stratospheric levels around the poles, strongest in winter Has caused closing of ozone layer.
	- ![[Pasted image 20221227131838.png]]
- ==Churchandpur Mao Fault and Mat fault== in Mizoram

## Other Important Facts

- CO2 in thermal springs are sourced from ==metamorphic decarbonation of rocks==. **Geothermal springs** are major source of CO2 emission
- Upwelling caused by a previous storm ==decreases the intensity== of the next one.
- Not all droughts caused by EL Nino, North Atlantic atmospheric disturbances also resp. **Rossby waves** that are waves of air current when hit Tibetan plateau suppress rainfall.
- ==Geminid meteor shower== occurs form an asteroid or extinct comet not in a comet.
- Axis of earth drifting more than usual due to ==melting glaciers==. North pole drifting Eastwards.
- **Lineament** : linear feature dictated by an underlying geological structure ex faults.
- Most Planets rotate **west to east** but Venus and Uranus rotate from east to west.
- **Halo** around sun appears when white light passes through ice crystals.
- **Supermoon** occurs when full moon coincides with Moon's closest approach/ Perigree.
- **Heat Dome** : traps hot air rising above. Cold air coming from poles and jet streams act as a dome which pushes the rising hot air below causing high temp.
- **Auroras** : formed when charged particles from solar winds comes in contact w/ gasses in atmosphere. Called Aurora Borealis/ Northern Lights in North Hemisphere and Aurora Australis in South. Martian Auroras are discrete/ disjointed since its magnetic field is unevenly distributed.
- Separation of charges in clouds where +ve charge moves upwards taken by lighter snow and -ve comes down brought by heavier hail. These -ve charges start to move downwards called stepped leader comes in contact w/ moving up +ve charge causes lightning.
- **Earth Overshoot Day** by Global Footprint Network : day when on which we have used all biological resources of earth which it can renew in a year. Day is coming early every year. We consume 1.7 earths/yr.
- **Seismic noise** : caused by persistent vibrations of ground ex earthquakes, volcanic eruptions etc.
- **Anthropocene** : new epoch in Earth's geological history has been proposed present geological time interval describe humanity's impact on env.
- **Summer Solstice**(stand still) occurs on June 21 caused by Earths tilt along axis on this day the

## Cyclone

### Why Bay of Bengal is Hotbed of Cyclones

- vastness ideal condition to create low pressure area
- shaped like a trough
- high sea surface temp
- more rainfall and warm air currents keep temp high
- constant inflow of fresh warm water
- lack of landmass
- absence of air movements

**Why not Arabian sea ?**

- strong winds do not allow build up of low pressure area
- lack of fresh water inflow helps keep temp low

### Fani in Odisha

- Advance release of funds from SDRF (State Disaster Response Fund) to State gov AP, Odisha, TN + WB, estd under the Disaster Management Act 2005 recomm of the 13th Fin Commission, Central Gov contributes 75% to 90% fund ambit MoHA audited by CAG, additional funding is given through National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).
- Seismic impact of human activities far reaching not localised eg fluid injection for petroleum extraction - instability in faults b/w rocks - trigger earthquakes, study lead to reliable models to mitigate earthquake hazard

### Naming of Cyclones

- WMO/UNESCAP assigns names for cyclones in BoB and Arabian Sea
- 8 member countires around this area give names
- Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre RSMC, New Delhi is responsible for naming these storms

### Recent Cyclones

- Hurricane Hanna in Texas
- Typhoon Goni - Phillipines
- Cyclone Nivar hit Puducherry
- Amphan in West Bengal
- Tauktae cyclone in Lakshadweep
- Yaas in Odisha

```ad-Answer

The melting of the Arctic ice and glaciers of the Antarctic differently affect the weather patterns and human activities on the Earth. 

The melting of the Arctic ice affects weather patterns by altering the global climate. The decrease in the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean has caused a warming of the atmosphere and ocean, which has led to changes in weather patterns across the globe. The melting of the Arctic ice has also caused sea levels to rise, which can lead to flooding in coastal areas. Furthermore, the melting of the Arctic ice has led to changes in ocean currents, which can affect the climate in other regions.

The melting of the glaciers of the Antarctic has a different effect on weather patterns and human activities. The melting of the Antarctic glaciers has caused sea levels to rise, which can lead to flooding in coastal areas. Additionally, the melting of the Antarctic glaciers has caused the ocean to become more acidic, which can have a negative effect on marine life. Furthermore, the melting of the Antarctic glaciers has caused changes in ocean currents, which can have an impact on the climate in other regions. Finally, the melting of the Antarctic glaciers has caused a decrease in the amount of fresh water available for human consumption, which can lead to shortages in certain areas.

1. How will the meeting of Himalayan glaciers have a far-reaching impact on the water resources of India? (हहमालय के हहमनदो के ं नपघलने का भारत के जल-सं साधनो पर ं हकस प्कार दूरगामी प्भाव होगा ?) 2020

```ad-Answer

The Himalayan glaciers are the main sources of fresh water for India, providing more than 60% of the country’s annual surface water supply. The retreating of these glaciers due to global warming is having a major impact on India’s water resources since it is reducing the amount of water available in the rivers. This will have immense implications for the country. It could lead to water scarcity in many parts of the region, decrease agricultural productivity, lead to an increase in conflicts over water and put an additional burden on India’s already fragile water resources. In addition, it could also lead to increased flooding and landslides which can impact the lives and livelihoods of people living in the affected regions. Therefore, the meeting of Himalayan glaciers will have a far-reaching impact on the water resources of India.

```ad-Answer

The behavior of the Indian monsoon has been subject to much debate in recent years, with some experts suggesting that it has been changing due to human-induced factors such as land use change and emissions of greenhouse gases. Here are 12 points that can be considered in this discussion:

1.  Land use change: Land use change, such as deforestation and urbanization, can alter the surface energy balance and change the atmospheric circulation patterns, which can impact the monsoon.
    
2.  Greenhouse gas emissions: The emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, has been increasing in recent years, which can lead to global warming and climate change, leading to changes in the monsoon.
    
3.  Changes in sea surface temperatures: Changes in sea surface temperatures, especially in the Indian Ocean, can affect the monsoon by altering the heat balance and atmospheric circulation.
    
4.  Air pollution: Air pollution, especially in the Indo-Gangetic plains, can affect the monsoon by reducing the amount of rainfall and changing the cloud formation processes.
    
5.  Alterations in soil moisture: Changes in soil moisture due to human activities, such as irrigation, can impact the monsoon by altering the amount of moisture available for evaporation.
    
6.  Changes in vegetation patterns: Changes in vegetation patterns, such as deforestation and agriculture, can alter the surface energy balance and impact the monsoon.
    
7.  Variations in ocean currents: Variations in ocean currents, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), can affect the monsoon by altering the heat balance and atmospheric circulation.
    
8.  Climate change: Climate change can impact the monsoon by altering the atmospheric circulation patterns and changing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.
    
9.  Natural variability: The monsoon is a naturally variable system and can be influenced by a number of internal and external factors, such as ENSO and volcanic eruptions, making it difficult to attribute changes solely to human activities.
    
10.  Data availability: There is limited long-term data available on the Indian monsoon, making it difficult to determine the exact extent to which it is changing and the reasons behind these changes.
    
11.  Regional variability: The monsoon is a regional system and its behavior can vary across different regions in India, making it difficult to make generalizations about its behavior.
    
12.  Ongoing research: The study of the Indian monsoon is ongoing and more research is needed to better understand its behavior and the impact of human activities on it.

1. Tropical cyclones are largely confined to South China Sea, Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Mexico.Why? (उष्णकहिबं धीय चरिवात असधकांितः दशक्णी चीन सागर, बं गाल की खाडी और मैक्सिको की खा ं डी तक ही पररसीगमत रहते हैं। ऐसा क्ो है?) 2014

```ad-Answer

Tropical cyclones are primarily confined to certain areas, such as the South China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gulf of Mexico, for a number of reasons:

1.  Warm waters: Tropical cyclones form over warm waters, with temperatures of at least 26°C. The waters in the South China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gulf of Mexico are warm enough to provide the energy required to sustain these storms.
    
2.  High humidity: High humidity is required for the formation of tropical cyclones. The South China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gulf of Mexico are regions with high humidity, which provides the necessary moisture for these storms to develop.
    
3.  Weak vertical wind shear: Vertical wind shear, which refers to the change in wind direction and speed with height, can disrupt the formation of tropical cyclones. The South China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gulf of Mexico are regions with weak vertical wind shear, which allows these storms to form and strengthen.
    
4.  Coriolis effect: The Coriolis effect, which is a result of the Earth's rotation, helps to steer tropical cyclones in a specific direction. The South China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gulf of Mexico are regions where the Coriolis effect is particularly strong, which helps to guide the formation and path of these storms.
    
5.  Monsoon winds: Monsoon winds, which are seasonal winds that bring moist air from the ocean to the land, are also important factors in the formation of tropical cyclones in these regions. The monsoon winds can provide the necessary moisture and low-level winds for the development of these storms.
    
6.  Availability of warm water: The South China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gulf of Mexico are regions that have a continuous supply of warm water, which helps to sustain the formation and development of tropical cyclones.
    
7.  Topographical features: The topographical features in these regions, such as the mountainous terrain in the Bay of Bengal and the shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico, can also play a role in the formation and development of these storms.
    
8.  Sea surface temperature patterns: The patterns of sea surface temperature in the South China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gulf of Mexico are favorable for the formation and development of tropical cyclones.
    
9.  Ocean currents: The ocean currents in these regions can play a role in the formation and movement of tropical cyclones. For example, the ocean currents in the Bay of Bengal can transport heat and moisture towards the land, which can contribute to the formation and intensification of these storms.
    
10.  Atmospheric conditions: The atmospheric conditions in the South China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gulf of Mexico are also favorable for the formation and development of tropical cyclones. For example, the low atmospheric pressure in these regions can help to create an environment that is conducive to the formation of these storms.

1. Most of the unusual climatic happenings are explained as an outcome of the El-Nino effect.Do you agree? (असामान् जलवायवी घिनाओ में से अ ं सधकांि एल-नीनो प्भाव के पररणाम के तौर पर स्पटि की जाती हैं। क्ा आप सहमत
हैं?) 2014

```ad-Answer

Yes, I agree that many of the unusual climatic happenings can be explained as an outcome of the El-Nino effect. El-Nino is a natural climate phenomenon that occurs when the ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator become warmer than normal. This can cause changes in the global climate pattern, leading to unusual weather events in different parts of the world.

For example, El-Nino can cause droughts in some parts of the world such as Australia and South America, while other parts may experience heavy rains and flooding. It can also lead to an increase in the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and typhoons in the Pacific Ocean. Additionally, El-Nino can cause warmer winters in some parts of the world and cooler summers in others.

El-Nino can also cause changes in the ocean currents, which can affect the distribution of nutrients and other factors that influence the health of marine life. This can lead to coral bleaching and a decrease in the number of fish in the ocean.

Overall, El-Nino can cause a wide range of unusual climatic happenings around the world.

1. Bring out the relationship between the shrinking Himalayan glaciers and the symptoms of climate change in the Indian sub-continent. (भारतीय उप-महाद्ीप में घिती हई हहमालयी हहमनहदयो और जलवायु पर ं रवत्भनके लक्णो के बीच सं बं ध उजागर कीज ं जए।) 2014

```ad-Answer

The shrinking of the Himalayan glaciers has a significant impact on the climate change in the Indian subcontinent. Here are some of the ways in which the two are related:

1.  Reduced water availability: The melting of glaciers contributes to the water cycle and is an important source of water for many rivers in the region. As the glaciers shrink, the water supply to these rivers is reduced, which can lead to water scarcity for agriculture, industry, and households.
    
2.  Increased flooding: As the glaciers shrink, there is a risk of increased flooding in the region due to the release of large volumes of water from glacial lakes. This can cause damage to infrastructure, homes, and agriculture, and can also lead to loss of life.
    
3.  Changing weather patterns: The Himalayan glaciers play a crucial role in regulating the climate in the region, and their shrinkage can lead to changes in precipitation patterns and air temperature. This can have significant impacts on agriculture and biodiversity in the region.
    
4.  Increased sea levels: The melting of glaciers contributes to sea level rise, which is a major symptom of climate change. This can have significant impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems, as well as on low-lying islands and delta regions.
    
5.  Amplified warming: The shrinkage of glaciers in the Himalayas is itself a symptom of climate change, and this in turn can amplify the warming trend in the region. This can lead to further melting of the glaciers, which can create a vicious cycle of warming and shrinkage.

1. The recent cyclone on the east coast of India was called "Phailin". How are the tropical cyclones named across the world? (भारत के पूवथी ति पर हाल ही में आए चरिवात को ‘फाइललन’ (Phailin) कहा गया। सं सार में उष्णकहिबं धीय

Tropical cyclones are named to help people easily identify them, and to facilitate communication between different countries and organizations. The process of naming tropical cyclones involves several international meteorological organizations and countries in the region affected by the cyclone.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) maintains a list of names for tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean, the Eastern North Pacific Ocean, and the Western North Pacific Ocean. Each name on the list is assigned to a specific storm, and the names are recycled every six years.

In the case of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, the practice of naming tropical cyclones was initiated by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the meteorological agencies of Bangladesh, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Yemen. The names are selected based on a pre-determined list and alternate between names submitted by different countries in the region.

1.  World Meteorological Organization (WMO): The WMO has a rotating list of names for tropical cyclones that form in the Atlantic Ocean, Eastern North Pacific Ocean, and the Western North Pacific Ocean.
    
2.  Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMCs): RSMCs are responsible for naming tropical cyclones in their respective regions. For example, the Indian Meteorological Department names tropical cyclones that form over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
    
3.  National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs): NMHSs in different countries also name tropical cyclones in their region.

1. Bring out the causes for the formation of heat islands in the urban habitat of the world. (सं सार केिहरी ननवास-स्ानो में ताप-द् ं ीपो के बनने के कारण बताइए।) ं 2013

```ad-Answer

Heat islands are areas in urban environments where temperatures are higher than the surrounding rural areas due to various human activities. Here are seven factors that contribute to the formation of heat islands:

1.  Increased impervious surfaces: The increasing amount of concrete and asphalt in urban areas prevents heat from being absorbed into the ground, which leads to higher temperatures in the surrounding environment.
    
2.  Reduced vegetation: Urbanization often leads to the removal of vegetation, which normally provides shade and helps to regulate temperatures.
    
3.  Increased human activity: Human activities such as transportation, industry, and energy use contribute to higher temperatures in urban areas.
    
4.  Lack of green spaces: Urban areas often have limited green spaces, such as parks and gardens, which provide shade and help to regulate temperatures.
    
5.  Urban design: Urban design can also contribute to heat islands. For example, buildings that are tall and densely packed together can trap heat and make temperatures in urban areas higher.
    
6.  Climate change: Climate change is leading to higher temperatures across the world, and this trend is particularly pronounced in urban areas due to the unique challenges posed by urban heat islands.
    
7.  Building materials: The materials used in buildings, such as dark-colored roofing and paving materials, can absorb and retain heat, contributing to higher temperatures in urban areas.

1. What do you understand by the phenomenon of temperature inversion in meteorology? How does it affect the weather and the habitants of the place? (मौसम-नवज्ान में ‘तापमान व्युत्क्रम’ की घिना से आप क्ा
समझते हैं? उस स्ान के मौसम तथिा ननवाससयो को यह कै से ं प्भानवत करता है?) 2013

```ad-Answer

Temperature inversion is a meteorological phenomenon in which the normal decrease in temperature with height is reversed, leading to a layer of warm air trapping cooler air below it.

This can occur in a number of ways, but is often seen in regions of high pressure, when the warm air above the surface is prevented from rising by a layer of colder air aloft.

Some of the effects of temperature inversion include:

1.  Poor air quality: Inversions trap pollutants close to the ground, leading to increased levels of air pollution.
    
2.  Reduced visibility: Inversions can cause a dense layer of fog or smog to form near the ground, reducing visibility.
    
3.  Stagnant weather: Because inversions prevent the normal mixing of the atmosphere, the weather in an inversion layer can become stagnant, with little or no wind.
    
4.  Health effects: The increased levels of pollution can have negative health impacts, especially for those with respiratory conditions.
    
5.  Impact on ecosystems: The buildup of pollutants can also have negative impacts on ecosystems, including soil and water pollution.
    
6.  Pests and diseases: The calm and stagnant weather conditions can lead to an increase in pests and diseases, which can have negative impacts on crops and wildlife.
    
7.  Effects on wildlife: The reduction in visibility can also have negative impacts on wildlife, as it can make it more difficult for them to find food and mates.
