1. Given the diversities among tribal communities in India, in which specific contexts should they be considered as a single category ? (भारत के जनजातीय समुदायो की ं नवनवधताओ को देखते ं हए हकस नवशिटि सन्भ्भ के अन्ग्भत उन्ें हकसी एकल रिेणी में माना जाना चाहहए ?) 2022

```ad-Answer

The question of whether tribal communities in India should be considered as a single category is a complex and nuanced one. The Indian government has historically categorized these communities under the Scheduled Tribe (ST) label, but there are still significant differences among these groups that should not be overlooked. Here are some points to consider:

-   Salient features: According to one source, there are a few key features that can indicate whether a community is tribal, such as belief in superstitions, subsistence-based economies, and isolation from the broader community [[1](https://www.iasuniverse.com/model-answer-qp2022-gs1given-the-diversities-among-tribal-communities-in-india-in-which-specific-contexts-should-they-be-considered-as-a-single-category/)]. However, these traits are not necessarily universal or definitive, and many tribal communities have adapted to modern times in various ways.
    
-   Cultural diversity: It's important to recognize that there is a great deal of diversity among India's tribal communities, and not all of them share the same beliefs, customs, or languages. For example, some may follow animistic religions or worship ancestors, while others may practice Hinduism or Christianity. Some may have a rich tradition of art or music, while others may be primarily known for their agricultural practices [[2](https://samajho.com/upsc/upsc-cse-2022-mains-gs-1-paper-model-answers/)].
    
-   Legal status: The Indian government has officially recognized certain communities as Scheduled Tribes, which gives them certain legal protections and benefits. However, this categorization is not always accurate or fair, and some communities may be excluded or misclassified. It's important to consider the historical and political context behind these labels and the potential impact they may have on the communities themselves [[3](https://www.drishtiias.com/upsc-mains-solved-papers/year/2022/gs-paper-1)].
    

Overall, it's clear that there is no easy answer to the question of whether tribal communities in India should be considered as a single category. While there may be some commonalities among these groups, it's important to recognize and respect their diversity and individuality. Any categorization or policy decision should be made with sensitivity and input from the affected communities themselves.
