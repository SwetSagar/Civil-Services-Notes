- Secularism opposed all forms of inter (in between religions) and intra (within religions) religious domination.

## 4.1 How to Promotes Secularism?

- Education
- Separation of state from religion
- State should not have a formal or a legal alliance with any religion
- Strict separation of state and religion is a feature of most western countries. This does not allow equality to prevail within and among religions.
- Indian secularism deals with the inter and intra religious equality, religious minorities, state supports religious reforms.
- Indian secularism's engagement with religion could be positive (right to establish their own educational institution) and negative (opposing religious tyranny like abolishing untouchability)

## 4.2 Criticism of Indian Secularism

- Anti-religious : disrespect to dogma, fanaticism, hatred and intervention in these by state.
- Secularism is a Western Import : it has a both western and non-western origin
- Minoritism
- Interventionist - it is not coercive but constructive
- Vote Bank politics -
- Impossible to attain complete secularism
