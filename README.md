# My Notes for UPSC Civil Services

These are the notes that I made while preparing for the `UPSC Civil Services Exam`. I had the opportunity to write **2 mains after having an AIR of 233 in NDA in the past**. Notes contain **General Studies and History Optional**. 

They are being optimised for github and would slowly be updated.They are `supposed to be an open source base` for future candidates to take a leaf out of. Thanks.

## Subject Notes and General Studies syllabus wise notes.

- Subject Notes here contains Geography, Environmental Studies, Economy and Essay.
- They are made with respect to their reference material and not syllabus wise.
- They are static in nature and have not been correlated with current affairs.
