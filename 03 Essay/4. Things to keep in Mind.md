![Concluding√Ñn_Essay Conclusion needs to be on a futuristic, optimistic note. You need to summarise the complete essay in 3-4 sentences, after which you can write your vision for future. You can source some useful terms from the speeches of PM Modi. Phrases like Sabka saath sabka vikas, Reform-PerformTransform, Building A New India etc can come handy. Rhetoric, lofty expressions, constitutional ideals, Sanskrit slokas and quotes are a good way to conclude your essay. But suppose in your introduction, if you had written about a fictitious character, then it's always advisable to end your write-up with a reference to that character. It gives a sense of completeness to the essay. ](Things-to-keep-in-Mind-image1-23165346.png)
