Fishes are **cold** blooded..

## Amphibians Are

- **Cold** blooded
- **Webbed** feet
- Breathe with lungs and gills
- Moist smooth skin
- Four legs (sometimes none)
- Lay eggs

## Reptiles

- **Cold** blooded
- Have **scales**
- Have dry skin
- Usually lay eggs
- Ear holes instead of ears
- 4 legs or no legs

Aves are **warm** blooded.

## Annelids

- bodies that are divided into **segments**
- well-developed internal organs
- don't have any limbs
- E.g: earthworms, leeches, roundworms

## Mollusks

- soft, skin-like organ covered with a hard outside **shell**
- mollusks that live on land are snail and **slug**
- mollusks that live in water are oyster, mussel, clam, squid and octopus

## Echinoderms

- **marine** animals
- have arms or spines that radiate from the center of their body
- Eg sea star, sea urchin, sand dollar and sea cucumber

## Arthropods

- have **limbs** with **joints** that allow them to move
- also have an exoskeleton
- include the crustaceans, insects, arachnids.

### Crustaceans

- live mostly in the **ocean/water**
- have a hard, external shell which protectstheir body
- Eg crabs, lobsters etc
![[Species--image5-00111392.jpg|300x300]]

### Insects

- have an **exoskeleton** that covers their entire body
- consists of 3 body parts and 6 legs
- beetle, butterfly, moth, dragonfly, bee, wasp and praying mantis.

### Arachnids :

- spiders, **scorpions**, **ticks** and mites
- do not have antennae
- have 2 body parts and 4 pairs of legs

The fresh-water algae are generally **green** or **blue-green** in colour, whereas the marine ones are red or brown.

## Bryophytes

- plant body is differentiated into a small stem and simple leaves, but true roots are absent
- usually grow in **moist** places. E.g. Liverworts, mosses

## Pteridophytes

- well-**differentiated** plant bodies, consisting of roots, stems and leaves. Moreover, they possess **vascular bundles**.
- eg. clubmosses, horse-tails and ferns

## Gymnosperms

- very simple flowers without accessory**whorls** and stamens
- Ex are Cycas, Pinus, Gnetum.

Angiosperms are

- **closed** seeded plants.
- Carpels have ovary, style and stigma
- Ovary develops into fruit and ovules into seeds.
- seeds remains within the fruits

![Stigma Style Ovule Pistal ](Species--image7-00111392.png)

There are 5 species of egg laying mammals :

- **Duck Billed Platypus**
- 4 species of Spiny Anteaters aka echidna. Are found only in Australia.

**Herb** is defined as a plant whose stem is always green and tender with height of not more than **1** meter.

**Shrub** is defined as a woody perennial plant. It is not more than
**6** metres in height.

**Epiphytes**

- plant growing on the host plant but not by the host plant. Only need help to get access to **light**.

Out of 7 colours in the visible part of spectrum, only red → plant gown in this light are small and blue → are etiolated/elongated are effective in photosynthesis.

Excessive high temperature results in death of plant due to coagulation of
**protoplasmic** proteins.

The **heartwood** is dead sapwood in the center of the
trunk.
Pith is the tiny dark spot of spongy living cells right in the center of the tree trunk.

The thin layer of living cells just inside the bark is called **cambium**.
**Pith** is the tiny dark spot of spongy living cells right in the center of the tree trunk.

Primary descending root formed by the direct prolongation of the radicle of the embryo.
Taproot
![](Species--image8-00111392.jpg)

**Lateral Root**

- Roots that arise from the tap root and spread laterally to support the tree.
**Adventitious Roots**
- Roots that are produced from the parts of the plant other than the radicle or its subdivi-sion.
- Buttresses - They are out - growths formed usually ver-tically above the lateral roots and thus connect the base of the stem with roots.
- Prop - Roots - produced from the branches of the tree which remain suspended in the air till they reach ground.
- Stilt - Roots - which emerged from the butt of a tree above ground level.

**Haustorial** roots are the roots of parasitic plants that can absorb water and nutrients from another plant.

**Mycorrhiza** : structure produced from the combination of the modified rootlet with fungal tissue.
