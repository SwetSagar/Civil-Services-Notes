## Critically Endangered :

- reduction in population ( **90**% over the last **10** years)
- population size (number less than 50 mature individuals)
- quantitative analysis showing the probability of extinction in wild in at least 50% in their 10 years
- extremely high risk of extinction in the wild

## A Taxon is Endangered when :

- reduction in population size (**70**% over the last **10** years)
- fewer than 250 mature individuals
- quantitative analysis showing the probability of extinction in wild in at least 20% within 20 years
- very high risk of extinction in the wild

## Vulnerable :

- reduction in population (**50**% over the last **10** years)
- fewer than 10,000 mature individuals
- probability of extinction in wild is at least 10% within 100 years
- high risk of extinction in the wild

## WPA Act of 1972

- **Poaching**, **smuggling** and illegal trade of animals listed Schedule 1 to Schedule 4 are prohibited
- Animals listed in Schedule 5 called Vermin they can be hunted.
- Plans are listed in Schedule 6. Their cultivation, collection, extraction, trade etc are prohibited.

### Conservation Reserve and Community Reserves Are the Outcome of Amendments to the Wild Life Protection Act in 2003.

- provides recognition, legal backing to the community initiated efforts in wildlife protection. Wildlife conservation is achieved without compromising community needs.

#### Conservation Reserves :

- area owned by the State gov adjacent to National Parks and Sanctuaries.
- It is managed through a Conservation Reserve Management Committee
- Tirunelveli was the first conservation reserve.

#### Community Reserve

- State Government may notify any community land or private land as a Community Reserve on mutual agreement.
- improving socio-economic conditions.
- Also managed through Management Committee. Any changes in land use pattern requires a resolution to be passed.

### Marine Protected Area :

- **intertidal** or **sub tidal** terrain along with overlaying water flora and fauna, cultural/historical features
- In India it is concentrated in small areas like lagoons, mangrooves, coral reefs etc.

#### Classified into 3 Categories :

- Category I - NP and Sanctuaries and having an entire areas in intertidal/sub tidal region.
- Category II - includes Islands that have major part in marine ecosys
- Category III A - includes sandy beaches beyond inter tidal region.
- Category III B - Includes evergreen/ semi ever green forests of Islands.
 - They are designated under WPA 1972.

#### Biosphere Reserves

- Man and Biosphere program is an **intergovernmental** Scientific Program.
- main governing body is International Coordinating Council.
- The concept of Biosphere Reserves was refined by a Task Force of UNESCO's MAB Programme in **1974**.
- The national Biosphere Reserve Programme was initiated in **1986**.

Criteria for designation as BR:

- must contain protected, minimally disturbed core
- Core must be bio-geographical unit
- involvement of local communities
- areas potential for traditional tribal or rural modes of living

 They are divided into 3 zones

- Core Zone : undisturbed area having numeour flora and fauna at all trophic levels. It should be kept free from all human interference.
- Buffer Zone : Activities like restoration, limited recreation, tourism etc can be done.
- Transition Zone : It has settlements, crop lands, managed forests etc.
 - The mgt of BR lies with the State/UT financial assistance and guidance is given by center.
 - The MABs World Network of Biosphere Reserve was started in 1977.

 Biodiversity Hotspot concept was put forth by **Norman Myers** in 1988. Its Criteria are :

- Species endemism : must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (ie 0.5% of worlds total) as endemics
- It has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat.

#### Tiger Reserve Includes :

- Core Zone : are notified by the **State** gov with an expert committee, rights of **ST's** should not be affected during protection.
- Buffer Zone : aims at coexistency of wildlife and human activity. Limits of such areas are determined in consulation with Gram sabha and committee.
- Alteration of boundaries of a tiger reserve be made on recom of NTCA and approval of National Board of Wildlife.

 State Gov cannot denotify a tiger reserve except in public interest with approval of NTCA.

 **Difference between National Park, Wildlife Sanctuary and Biosphere Reserve**

- NP and Wildlife Sanctuary both are established under WPA 1972
