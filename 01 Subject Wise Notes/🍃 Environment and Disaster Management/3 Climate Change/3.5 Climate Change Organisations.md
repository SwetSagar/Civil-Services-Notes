## UNFCCC (Framework Convention on Climate Change)

- Result of UN Conference on Environment and Dev. Rio de Janerio 1992
- Limit average global temp inc

### Kyoto Protocol - COP 3 1997

- To strengthen Global response after realising the inadequacy of convention
- It commits Industrial countries to stabilise GHG whereas Convention encouraged
- Through **binding emission reduction target**, reporting and verification, flexible market based mechanism like emission trading and compliance system
- **Joint Implementation mechanism** : Developed country can earn emission reduction units ERUs worth 1 tonne of CO2
- **Clean Dev mechanism CDM** : provides emission offset instruments CERs which are saleable certificates equivalent to 1 tonne CO2
- **Carbon Trading** : exchanging emission permits
- **Emission trading/ Cap and trade** : the balance b/w the amt of Carbon to be emitted and actually emitted can be traded
- Non-compliance leads to taking away or privileges like cap and trade, Joint implementation etc.

- Outcomes
    - Gender Action plan promote equality
    - Local communities and Indigenous people participation
    - Ocean Pathway partnership
    - **Talanoa dialogue** : to help countries enhance their nationally determined Contribution NDCs
    - **Insu Resilience Global Partnership** - b/w G20 and V20 nations (49 vulnerable countries estd by Male Declaration)

### COP 24 Katowice, Poland 2018

- Paris rulebook finalised to operationalise 2015 Paris Agreement, help provide info about countries NDCs called Katowice package

### COP 25 Madrid, Spain also Called Blue COP 2019

- Was to be held in Chile
- Complete Rule book to the Paris Climate replace Kyoto Protocol in 2020

### COP 26 Glasgow, Scotland 2021

- Led to Glasgow climate pact for 'Phase down' of unabated coal power.

#### Other Mechanisms of UNFCCC

- Special Climate Change Fund SCCF
    - Finance ToT, Adaptation, Energy, transport etc projects
    - Global Environment Facility GEF - operates SCCF
- Fast start Finance funding of 30bil $ by developed countries to most vulnerable countries

## REDD and REDD+

- Reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation
- REDD+ includes incentives for conservation, sustainable mgt etc
- Which could be passed to local communities for their efforts

## GEF

- Created in 1991 to make a financial mechanism under UNFCCC
- 6 focal areas of biological diversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, ozone layer depletion, persistent organic pollutants.

## Climate Smart Agriculture

- 14 % of all global greenhouse gases is from agriculture,
- aims to absorb/hold carbon into the soil
- Increase yields, make yields more resilient, make farms solution to the climate change
- Through conservation tillage, promote carbon soil capture, soil fertility management, better weather forecasting.

## Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC

- Estd by the UNEP and World Meteorological organisation in 1988
- Secretariat coordinates all IPCC work HQ at Geneva
- 195 countries are members
- Does not conduct any research nor does it monitors climate related data
- Scientific data is contributed voluntarily, review is done, assessment reports written for Policymakers

## National Green-house Gas Inventories Program -

- By IPCC provides methods to estimate greenhouse gas emissions

**Green Economy** - Sustainable dev and Poverty eradication by decarbonising, using environmental justice and equity, conserve biosphere



 **Ecological Footprint** - measure of demand for natural resources compared to the planet's ecological capacity to regenerate them. Humanity uses 1.5x times as fast as Earth can replace them



 **Carbon footprint** - amt of carbon being emitted by an activity or organisation 54% of ecological footprint

## Green Climate Fund

 - GCF was set up in 2010 under UNFCCC to ==channel funding from developing countries towards climate change central to raise $100bil a yr by 2020== every year. It is governed by CoP.

	- Particular attention to LDCs, SIDS (Small Island Developing States) and African States.
