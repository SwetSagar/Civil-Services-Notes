## Heat Wave

- IMD criterai for decl is 40°C for plains and 37°C for coastal areas 30° for Hilly areas
- Dec when departure from normal temp is 4.5-6.4° C
- Severe when > 6.4° C
- For plains heatwave is considered based on actual max temp > 45 and severe > 47C.
- Period of abnormally high tem, occur b/w March June.

### Causes

- Hot winds blowing from deserts, anticyclone formation, rising global temp, shift in air current/weather pattern, depletion of Ozone layer, Jet stream.
- High temp 9 degress, humidity, duration of 5 days min, lack of moisture.
- concrete and paved surfaces show magnified effect, Urban heat islands, high intensity of UV rays.

### Impact

- Heat stroke, exhaustion, cramps, dehydration, nausea, dizziness, headaches, lead to D,

### Mitigation

- 4 imp criteria forecasting, build capacity, community outreach, inter agency coop, build green cover, estd cooling centres, Public awareness, protect environment
- Id heat hot spots and implement local Heat action plans, inter agency coordination
- promote traditional adaptation practices, policy intervention and adaptation across sectors
- simple design features in houses

### Challenges

- Lack of research, narrow analysis, of urban ward level data, less active usage of public message delivery, lack of Public awareness, half-hearted attempts

## Cold Waves

- IMD declares cold wave when min temp is equal or less than 10deg Celsius at weather stations 4.5deg - 6.4deg below normal temp in the plains.
- Very cold air over large area, preceded by weather events, blizzards or ice storms.
- Associated w/ EL Nino, cyclones, Jet Streams, western disturbances, cold wave risks
- Distribution pattern.
    - DEC JAN in PUN, HAR, RAJ; snowfall in Himalayas, cold winds from Caspian sea.
- Impact - damage to agriculture, roads, hypothermia etc.

**Reasons for Cold wave In India**

- Lack of western disturbance which bring down temp during day due to precipitation and keep night temp steady.
- Snowfall in Upper Himalayas
- Downward subsidence of cold air over north India from upper Himalayas bring down temp
- La Nina conditions favors cold wave.

**Impact of cold wave conditions**

- CW creates wider day and night temp impacting agricultural practices in Rabi season.
- Would affect the productivity of cash crops ex coffee.
- Increases incidence of diseases.

**Mitigation**

- Location specific measures, light irrigation to farmers per need, convert schools etc to shelters, promote outreach
- Lack of preparation, preparedness, community participation
