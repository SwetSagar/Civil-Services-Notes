- Large waves, long wavelength and period caused due to undersea disturbance
- Large, impulsive displacement of sea bed level, landslide triggered tsunamis
- Risk : occur rarely in IN ocean
- Distribution Pattern : both East West coastlines are vulnerable, earthquake of 6.5 or greater required
- Effects depends on seismic event that generated the tsunami, distance from its point of origin, configuration of depth of water in oceans

## Tsunami Warning

- Predictability through international tsunami warning sys, regional warning sys,
- INCOIS gives warning in IN 3 stations in Portblair, Minicoy, Shillong 10 minutes in advance
- ITEWC - IN Tsunami Early Warning Sys by UNESCO it consists of national and international seismic station, sea level gauge station, buoys, 400 seismometers, real time processing of data 4.0 and above

## NDMA Guidelines

- Tsunami risk assessment and Vulnerability analysis through dev of models, INHD Naval Hydrographic Department
- Preparedness - Real time Seismic Monitoring Network RTSMN be estd under IMD, undersea observation platform being worn away, National Data Buoy program by NIOT, Tsunami escape direction sign boards

### Structural Mitigation Measures

- ex cyclone shelters, submerged sand barriers, sand dunes with sea weeds, mangroves and coastal forests
- Local knowledge centres along coast lines
- Construction of location specific sea walls and coral reefs
- Dev of break waters as buffer zones, bio shield - narrow strip of land along coastline
- ID of vulnerable structures, retrofitting them
- Strict enforcement of CRZ, adopt techno legal models to ensure compliance
- Emergency tsunami response - equipping first responders, tsunami safe zoning, planning, design, construction practice etc
- Ensuring Implementation - aggressive capacity building, use state of the art equipments, conduct regular drills

## Challenges :

- lack of easily accessible T documentation,
- lack of high resolution near shore bathymetric topographic data,
- inadequate awareness,
- lack of peoples part in strengthening disasters preparedness, mitigation
- emergency in coastal areas,
- lack of traditional knowledge to tackle
