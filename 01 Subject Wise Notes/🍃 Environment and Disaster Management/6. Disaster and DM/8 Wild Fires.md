- Helps in promoting natural regeneration, improve soil nutrient, hasten decay of vegetation, balances ecosystem, prevent inc of invasive species

## Mitigation

- Vegetation management, Codes and Ordinances,
- Bark Beetle Management, Public education,
- Research, fire spreads if there is continuous supply of fuel,
- participation of volunteers, arrange fire-fighting drills,
- proper utilisation of media

## Challenges

- R&D, half-hearted attempts to study effects of post fire,
- Narrow spatial reach,
- need to develop tools methods to minimise,
- awareness
