---

- Type of mass wasting, downward movt of rock debris, 15% of land area, north movt of IN plate

## Vulnerability Zones -

- Very high V Z - highly unstable, relatively young mountain, high rainfall, steep slope, WG, Nilgiris, intense human activities
- High V Z - intensity and frequency little less than VHVZ
- Moderate to Low V Z - Trans Himalayan areas of Ladakh, Spiti Valley, Aravalli, WG EG, Deccan plateau, mining areas of IN

## Causes

- Heavy rain, deforestation, Earthquakes, building of roads - dislodges rocks/ support structures, shifting agri NE part of IN, Urbanisation

## Consequences

- Short term impact - loss of natural beauty, roadblocks, river channels blocked, diversion of river courses, loss of life and property
- Long term impact - landscape changes can be permanent, loss of cultivable land, env impacts, drying up of sources of water
- Management of Landslides -
	- Regulation Enforcement, Emergency preparedness, Public Awareness Education, Capacity building, Knowledge Network, R&D

## Hazard Mitigation

- adopt area specific measures, hazard mapping, restriction on construction dev activities, promote large scale afforestation program, terrace farming, retaining walls, Restrict dev in prone areas, prepare codes on excavation, protect existing dev, insurance compensation

## Challenges

- integrate DM plans at different levels, techno legal regime to introduce slope protection, zero tolerance against deliberate env violence, innovation in management of team, Estd knowledge network
