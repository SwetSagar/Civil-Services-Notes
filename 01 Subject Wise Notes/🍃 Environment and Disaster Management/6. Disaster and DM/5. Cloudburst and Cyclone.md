- IMD nodal centre for warning, INSAT satellites used

### Mitigation

- Efficient forecast, rapid dissemination of warning, cyclone shelters
- Coastal Belt plantation, Hazard mapping through meteorological records, land use control,
- engineered structures - construct stilts on earth mound row of planted trees, buildings be water resistant, protect river embankments, strong halls to community shelter
- Flood management, improve vegetation cover, coastal shelterbelt plantation

#### National Cyclone risk Mitigation Project NCRMP in Vulnerable States

- 4 components are A - last mile connectivity
- B - Structural Non Structural measures
- C - Technical assistance for risk mitigation
- D - Project Mgt and implementation support

### Challenges

lack of adequate response, planning, coordination, communication infra lack, end facilities
