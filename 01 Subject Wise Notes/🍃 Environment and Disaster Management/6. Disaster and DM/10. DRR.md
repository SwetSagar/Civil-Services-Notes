## Disaster Risk Mgt 

- Quoting IPCC data is important here.
- Integrated Dis Risk Mgt based on probability assessment and simulation exercises. better land use planning and life line infra - prep a city master plan. Current disaster mgt committees do not have private sector resprenatation.
- Special disaster mgt cell eg like in Mum under MumDMC undertakes vulnerability assessment and put in place tech solutions for it.
- Need to decentralise dis mgt agencies to ward and communtiy levels. scientific contour mapping of vulnerable areas is missing.
- Storm surges can couple with floods other water related hazards.
- permission for making new buildings new low lying areas should be controlled.
- Bureau of Indian standards does the hazard zonation, disaster mgt committess at gram panchayat levels are missing this inhibits people participatory approaches.
- Schematic diagram showing multiple stakeholder approach will improve answer writing.
- more involvement of ngo's in drm and Community Based Organisatons (CBO's are of 2 types formal-by gov and informal by private orgs).
- Organisation of Setus as bridge bodies that would act in dissemination of information between communities and the goverment as was used after Bhuj earthquake aka called cluster level information centre. help in speedy recovery. They took up campaings like ID the vulerable, anti corruption campaign, grivance redressal.
