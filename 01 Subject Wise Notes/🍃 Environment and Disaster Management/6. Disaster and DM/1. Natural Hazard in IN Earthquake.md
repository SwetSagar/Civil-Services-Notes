- Secondary : ex fires, dams, landslides, tsunami, chemical spills et
- Tertiary : ex PTSD, long term psychological issues, loss of livelihood etc

### Mitigation

- Emphasis on preparedness, mitigation
- Earthquake monitoring centre, Vulnerability map disseminate risk info, planning, upgrade imp buildings through retrofitting, community preparedness public education, soil type analysed and structure be engineered
- Encourage indigenous methods - ex Bhonga in Kutch, Dhajji Diwari in JK, Eka in Assam #important
- Quick and effective response
- National Earthquake Risk mitigation Project by NDMA, National Building Code
- Challenges to Mitigation - inadequate enforcement, absence of earthquake resistant feature, lack of formal training, lack of awareness, absence of sys of licensing

### NDMA Guidelines

- Seismically safe design be ensured by C and S
- Selective seismic strengthening, retrofitting of existing structures - buildings of national imp, critical buildings, public utility structures, etc
- Regulation and enforcement by S gov
- Awareness and preparedness through handbooks on earthquake safety, seismic safety manuals, manual on structural safety audit
- Capacity development among target groups ex elected reps, gov officials, professionals, NGOs etc
- Emergency response undertaken through Incident Command system
