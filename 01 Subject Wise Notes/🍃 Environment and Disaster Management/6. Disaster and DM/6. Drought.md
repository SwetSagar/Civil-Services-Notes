- Mismatch b/w supply and demand, affected by variables like temp, humidity, solar radiation, wind patterns.
- Types are Meteorological (rainfall), Agricultural (soil moisture 30%), Hydrological (reservoirs), Ecological.
- 5 drought risks : Drought Week, Agri Drought (4x DW), Seasonal, Drought Year, Severe Drought Year.
- Drought Risk : annual variation in rainfall 80% rainfall is received in 100 days, 21% area received 70cm, rainfed agri more prominent, groundwater irrigation aggravates situation, declining per capital availability, abandoning of traditional water harvesting sys.
- 30% area D prone, 12% pop.
    - Extreme D affected ar - parts of RAJ, west of Aravalli hills, Jaisalmer Barmer
    - Severe - East RAJ, parts of MP, eastern Maha, interior AP, KTAKA,
    - Moderate - North RAJ, HAR, JHA, TN, interior KTAKA
- Early Indicators
    - Delay in onset, break in Monsoon, Insufficient rain, distribution, rise in price of fodder, drying sources, out migration of rural pop,
- Impact (PESTLE)
    - Wildlife migration, man animal conflict, reduced stream flow, depletion of ground water table, migration of pop, scarcity of water, exacerbate social tensions
- Slow onset, affects livelihoods of people over large area, longer duration, mostly rural phenomena
- Mitigation
    - Water harvesting, conservation, monitoring, sow resistant crops, livelihood planning, better farming methods, planning, drip irrigation/ sprinkler irrigation, cloud seeding.
- D crisis management plan.
    - Immediate emplo under MGNERGA, PDS, recharge groundwater, waive farmer loans
- Challenges : state wise dev of standard procedures, vulnerability maps, absence of crisis mgt authority, ineffective dissemination, ineffective monitoring, lack of community participation.
