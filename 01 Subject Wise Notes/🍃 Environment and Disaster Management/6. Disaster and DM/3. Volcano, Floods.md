- Occurs in continental weak zones, only Barren Island

## Floods

- 40mil hectare flood prone
- Flash floods - very fast rise and recession, small volume and high discharge, occurs in hilly sloping lands, depression/ cyclonic storms causes, sudden release of water, warning using Doppler radars

### Natural Causes

- Heavy rainfall,
- sediment deposition - river beds shallow,
- Cyclone - sea waves spreads water in coastal areas,
- Change in course, Tsunami, Lack of lakes

### Anthropogenic Causes

- Deforestation, interference in drainage system,
- international dimension, population pressure,
- poor water and sewerage mgt

### Vulnerability

- 85% rainfall in 3-4 months
- **Brahmaputra basin** : monsoon, fragile hills susceptible to erosion, frequent earthquakes, cloud bursts
- **Ganga** : mostly done by northern tributaries, RAJ MP experience of heavy floods, encroachment of flood plains
- **NW River Region** : inadequate surface drainage causes inundation and water logging, indiscriminate use of water for irrigation - drainage problem water logging, rivers change their course frequently
- **Central and Deccan IN** : inundation, destroy valuable crops, infra, millions rendered homeless,

### NDMA Guidelines

- Construct reservoirs, dams, other water storages
- Build embankments/flood Levees/ Flood Walls
- Restoring original Drainage system
- Channel improvement/ desilting/ dredging of rivers
- Diversion of flood water into naturally/ artificially constructed channel
- Catchment area treatment

### Non Structural Measures

- **Flood plain zoning** : regulate land use,
- **flood proofing** : providing raised platform for shelter
- flood management plans,
- Integrated water resources management
- **Apada Mitra #scheme**- train community volunteers in prone districts

## Urban Floods

### Caused

- heavy rainfall in short period,
- urbanisation,
- low drainage capacity

### Impact and Mitigation

- localised,
- disruption of water supply, communication etc

### Mitigation

- Pre Monsoon phase : estimation of emergency needs, familiarisation of stakeholders, ID teams to maintain drains and roads
- During : timely warning, response focuses primarily on emergency relief, mental health support
- Post : Rehab

#### NDMA Guidelines

- Inventory of water supply,
- catchment as basis of design,
- Contour data determine boundaries
- **Design flow** ot estimate peak flow rates,
- Removal of Solid waste,
- Drain inlet connectivity,
- Rain Gardens
- ID areas at risk classification of structure, Response, Sanitation, Capacity Dev,
- Urban flooding cells to coordinate all activities

### Existing Challenges

- Less imp to comprehensive risk assessment,
- ignorance of mapping different factors,
- unsatisfactory coordination among diff institutions,
- lack info sharing
- disintegrated investment decision
- lack of consultation w/ stakeholder
