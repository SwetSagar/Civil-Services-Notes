**4 types of Carbon**

1. **Black Carbon** : They are also black carbon that cause more pollution that Brown carbon. 
	- Component of fine particulate matter of size 2.5 micro meter. 
	- Consists of pure carbon that originates from incomplete complete combution of fossil fuels, coal, biofuel, biomass etc 
	- It originates from pyrolysis. Ex Soot
1. **Brown Carbon** : They are green house gases ex CO2. 
	- Smoke released by combustion of organic matter that coexists with black carbon when released in atmosphere.
	- Significant global warming factors that disturbs the temperature pattern of atmosphere and cloud forming process.
3. **Blue Carbon** : Captured by worlds oceans and coastal ecosystems. Stored in the form of aquatic biomass ex seagrasses, mangroves, marshes are ex of vegetated coastal blue carbon ecosystems.
4. **Green Carbon** : Carbon captured into terrestrial plant biomass in photosynthesis and stored in plants and soils of natural ecosystems and is vital part of carbon cycle.

- Ionising radiation have high penetration power viz X rays, cosmic rays and atomic radiations

 Types of radiation particles :

- Alpha particles - blocked by a piece of paper and human skin
- Beta - penetrates through skin but glass and metal can block it
- Gamma - can penetrate and damage cells, only be blocked by thick concrete

- [[5.1 Acts and Policies#E-Waste Management Rules 2016]]

## Solid Waste

- discarded hazardous materials from industries, agriculture or communities ex garbage, refuse, sludge etc

### Plastic Wastes Are Most Common Solid Waste

- Effects
- land gets littered, causes reproductive problems in humans and wildlife
- **Dioxin** (highly carcinogenic and toxic) by-product of the manufacturing process of plastic is one of the chemicals believed to be passed on through **breast milk** to the nursing infant.
- Burning of plastics, especially PVC releases **dioxin** and **furan** into the atmosphere.
- Contamination of groundwater and soil through landfills is known as **leaching**. To counter this **sanitary** landfills are made.
- Types are Municipal, Hazardous, Biomedical/hospital ex formaldehyde, phenols, anatomical waste
- [[5.1 Acts and Policies#Solid Waste Management Rules SWM 2016|Solid Waste Management Rules 2016]] #PrelimsPYQ

- Open dumps, landfills, sanitary landfills, incineration plants, pyrolysis, composting etc
 - Waste Minimisation Circles WMC : WB assisted, for minimising waste in Industrial clusters and plants

## Plastic Pollution

- plastic contamination of marine environment and land
- rate of UV induced photo-oxidative degradation is very slow and there is no easy way of collection of debris
- they degrade to give out micoparticulate particles <20microns in size adversely affecting marine animals

## **Thermal pollution**

- is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural aquatic environment caused by human influence.
- Sources are power plants, cooling water from factories, soil erosion, deforestation
- Causes algal bloom, affects ecosys composition
- Impact : death of acqutic organisms, migration of animals
- can also be caused by releasing extremely cold water
- Control Measure
	- **Cogeneration** : process through which, the excess heat energy from generating electricity can be used in another manufacturing process that needs such energy. #important
	- treatment of discharge water their efficient use esp in power plants.

## Bioremediation :

- **Bioremediation** is the use of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) to degrade the environmental contaminants into less toxic forms.
- It can be monitored indirectly by measuring the Oxidation Reduction Potential or redox in soil and groundwater, pH, temperature, oxygen content, electron acceptor/donor concentrations, and concentration of breakdown products.

### In Situ Bioremediation :

- Bioventing -supply of air and nutrients through wells to contaminated soil to stimulate the growth of indigenous bacteria.
- Biosparging - Injection of air under pressure below the water table to increase groundwater oxygen concentrations.
- Bioaugmentation - Microorganisms are imported to a contaminated site to enhance degradation process

### Ex Situ :

- Landfarming - contaminated soil is excavated and spread over a prepared bed and periodically tilled until pollutants are degraded.
- Biopiles - it is a hybrid of landfarming and composting. Engineered cells are constructed as aerated composted piles. Uses petroleum hydrocarbons.
- Bioreactors -it involves the processing of contaminated solid material (soil, sediment, sludge) or water through an engineered containment system.
- Composting

### Genetic Engineering Approaches to Bioremediation :

- **Phytoremediation** is use of plants to remove contaminants from soil and water.
- Phytoextraction / phytoaccumulation is the process by which plants accumulate contaminants into the roots and above ground shoots or leaves.
- Phytotransformation or phytodegradation refers to the uptake of organic contaminants from soil, sediments, or water and their transformation to more stable, less toxic, less mobile form.
- Phytostabilization is a technique in which plants reduce the mobility and migration of contaminated soil.
- Phytodegradation or rhizodegradation is the breakdown of contaminants through the activity existing in the rhizosphere.
- Rhizofiltration is a water remediation technique that involves the uptake of contaminants by plant roots.

### **Mycoremediation** And Mycofiltration

- is a form of bioremediation in which fungi are used to decontaminate the area.
 - Mycofiltration is a similar process, using fungal mycelia to filter toxic waste and microorganisms from water in soil.

## Acid Rain

- Rain with a pH of less than **5.6** is acid rain.
- concentrated in industrialised belt of nothern hemisphere
- common in mountainous areas
- impacts soil, wildlife, microorganisms, Vegetation and Humans
- It increases the effect of other harmful pollutants this is called a trigger effect ex Mercury, Al, Cadmium, Lead, Asbestos

### Types of Deposition

 - Wet Deposition : acid air blown to areas where weather is wet, rainout and washout are processes that remove gases and particles from atmosphere
 - Dry Deposition : in areas where weather is dry

### The Sources that Lead to the Formation of Acid Rain Are :

- Sulphur oxides
- Nitrogen oxides
- **Formic** acid
- **Chlorine**
- Phosphoric
- Hydrochloric acid
- Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.
