Q.	What are the most limiting factors of terrestrial ecosys?
A.	Moisture and Temperature.

**Terrestrial Ecosystem** : Land based community of organisms and the interactions of biotic and abiotic components in a given areas.

An ecosystem is the interaction of pants and animals with non-living things whereas biome is a large region of the world that has similar plants, animals and other organisms that are adapted to the terrain and weather of that region. There are 7 types of land biomes.

## 1. Tundra

'Tundra' means barren land found where env conditions are scarce. They are treeless regions found in the arctic and on top of mountains where climate is cold and windy and rainfall is scant.
They are also categorised as biomes

2 types of Tundras :

- **Arctic tundra** near the polar ice caps. The south pole tundra is small as it is covered by the **ocean**. Polar bears, arctic foxes etc are found here.
	- permafrost is a feature of it. They are regions of soil that are frozen for more than 2 years and extend 450 meters below the surface.
- **Alpine tundra** : is there in all latitudes at high mountains and show variation in day and night temperatures.

## 2. Taiga

- Also called boreal forest in North America and categorised as biomes. They are found in the sub arctic regions below Tundra.
- They also have permafrost and along with bedrocks does not allow to drain top layer of the soil creating shallow bogs called muskegs.
- Vegetation consists of coniferous forests, pines, spruces, larches etc.
- Found only in northern hemisphere.

## 3. Forest

**Coniferous aka Boreal forest**

- characterised by **high rainfall**, **seasonal climate** with **long winters and short summers**.
- Soils have **thin podzols**, are **acidic and mineral deficient**.
- Productivity and community stability is low.

**Temperate deciduous forest**

- moderate climate and **broad-leafed** deciduous trees,
- shed leaves in fall, soils are podzolic and deep.

**Temperate evergreen forest**

- in regions with **Mediterranean type climate** of warm dry summer and cool moist winter
- have low broad leaves, fires are common.

**Temperate rain forest**

- rain is high fog is very high, diversity of plant and animal is low.
- They are also classfied as biomes.

**Tropical rain forest** :

- occur **near equator**, rainfall is more than 200cm and also categorised as biomes.
- trees are vertically stratified, soils are red latosols and very thick
- high rate of leaching makes it unfit for agri is however compensated by increased organic matter presence.

**Tropical seasonal forests aka monsoon forest**

- have high rainfall but pronounced wet and dry periods.

**Subtropical rain forests**

- trees are evergreen and broad leaved, ephiphytes are common, diff b/w winter and summer climate is less

#### State of Indian Forest Cover #Report 2019 #important

- by Forest Survey of India under MoEFCC
- Forest Cover (Area-wise) : Madhya Pradesh> Arunachal Pradesh> Chhattisgarh> Odisha> Maharashtra
- Forest Cover (Percentage): Mizoram (85.4%)> Arunachal Pradesh (79.63%)> Meghalaya (76.33%)
- Forest cover includes are with more than 10% canopy density and more than 1 hectare area.
- Total forest cover is 712249 sq km ie 21.67% of total geographic area.
- States with most increase are Karnataka (1,025 sq km) > Andhra Pradesh (990 sq km) > Kerala (823 sq km) > J&K (371 sq km) > Himachal Pradesh (334 sq km).
- Forest Cover in NE is 65.05% of its geographic area.
- Except Assam and Tripura all NE states showed decrease.
- Tree cover is area with less than 1ha cover.
- Indias tree cover is 2.89%. Maharashtra has the highest inc in tree cover.
- Total Carbon stock of India is 7.124 bil tons.
- Gujarat has the largest area of wetland followed by West Bengal.

**Deforestation** : Causes are Shifting cultivation, Development projects, fuel requirement from wood, raw material requirement of timber, overgrazing, agriculture, mining, urbanisation etc

## 4. Grassland :

- rainfall **25-75** cm per year, found in temperate climates
- In India, found mainly in high Himalayas rest of India has Steppes → forage only during wet season → grasses are always present
    - Steppes occur in Western Rajasthan rainfall is 20cm. Soil is exposed, sometimes rocky w/ dunes
- **Savannas** found in central and eastern Rajasthan rainfall is 50cm.
	- Trees like Khetri grow.
    - Serve as grazing land - leads to reduction of energy flow, breakdown of biogeochemical cycles.
    - Fires are very common

## 5. Desert :

There are 4 main types of deserts

1. Hot and Dry Deserts
	- **25** cm of rainfall or regions with **hot temperature**, mid latitude regions
	- perennial plant like creosote bush, cactus
	- In shallow depressed areas with salt deposits - geesewood, seepwood (flora) and salt grasses are common.
	- Siltation, salt accumulation is a problem
	- Plants are mostly shrubs; leaves are absent or reduced, leaves and stems are succulent and store water. Stems could also contain chlorophyll. Roots are spread over large area.
	- Animals are fast runners, nocturnal, excrete concentrated urine, have longs legs to keep away from hot ground, Seeds are imp source of water for animals.
2. Semi Arid Deserts
	- are also known as steppe climate.
	- are a little colder than deserts, summers are followed by winters with a little rain.
	- mostly found in the fringes of subtropical deserts
3. Coastal Deserts
4. Cold Deserts
	- rainfall **40cm** and temp b/w 0 to -50 deg C.
	- Soil : type is sandy to sandy loam, poor in organic matter, pH varies from neutral to alkaline with low water retention capacity.
	- Asiatic Ibex, Tibetan Argali, Ladakh Uriyal, Bharal, Tibetan Antelope (chiru) etc are found.
	- Trees are alpine mesophytes. Junipers, Birch, rhododendrons in Alphine zone are found. No vegetation found in perpetual snow zone.

### Thar Desert

**Flora in the Indian Thar desert** could be divided into 2 :

1. Depending directly upon the rain :
- Further divided into 2 types **ephemerals** and rain perennials.
- **Ephemerals** are delicate annuals, do not have xerophilous adaptations, have a slender stem.
	- Xerophilous adaptation are plant adaptation for very dry climated ex long roots, fleshy stems(cactii), thin leaves(acacia)
	- they are short lived plants growing only when there is water availability or the climate is favorable.
- **Rain perennials** are visible above ground only during rainy season, but have a perennial under ground stem.
	- They grow throughout the year.
1. Depending on presence of subterranean water :
- Well-developed root system, consists of slender woody tap root.
- have xerophilous adaptations like reduced leaves, wax coatings, thick cuticles etc

**Fauna in Indian Deserts**

- Great Indian Bustard, Blackbuck, wild ass, chinkara, caracal etc are found.
- Flamingoes also found in Rann of Kutcch

**Desertification** :

- Causes - Mining, over grazing, agriculture, Dev of activities, deforestation
- Programs to counter - IWMP, NAP, NM for Green IN, National Watershed Dev, MGNREGA, Desert dev program
