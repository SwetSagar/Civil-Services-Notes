- Cost of Env degradation is about 6% of IN GDP or Rs 3.75 trillion

## Pollution in IHR

- expansion, trekking, tourism etc has caused continued waste dumping
- unplanned growth, non compliance w/ prescribed norms and guidelines

### Various Initiatives Taken to Clean IHR Region :

- HP banned plastic brought laws for disposal of non-biodegradable **garbage**, increased minimum **thickness** of plastic etc
- Nainital Lake has adopted the ==Mission Butterfly program for scientific garbage disposal==.
- ==Lake and Waterways Dev Authority LAWDA== has taken initiative to control pollution **in Dal Lake**
- Assam Hill Land and Ecological Sites #Act, 2006 taken up ==to prevent indiscrminate cutting of hills and filling of water bodies==.

### Recomendations to Combat Pollution

- guidelines to prohibit indiscriminate disposal of garbage
- treatment segregation at point of source, document waste composition
- 4R principle, innovation in treatment, garbage management
- prevent fragmentation of habitat in hill areas, designate areas for dev
- enforce architechtural norms, prevent deforestation, integrated development
- Community based ecotourism as sustainable alternative to commercial tourism ex Himalayan Homestays, Sikkim's Ultimate Tourist Destination policy

## Sand Mining

- process of removal of sand and grave

### Impact of Sand Mining

- causes stripping of sand natural carpet that causes downstream erosion
- prevents sand from acting as aquifers
- revenue loss to exchequer, forces river to change its course
- adversely impacts habitat of micro-organism
- damagest coastal ecosystem

### Suggestions to Combat

- use manufactured sand as alternative : produced from stones used for aggregates
- use fly ash from industries as alternative of sand.
- periodic assessment of sand bed, prudence to lease out mining
- make sand mining to be carried out only by labour

## Palm Oil - Environmental Issues and India's Role in it #important #PrelimsPYQ

- ==33% of vegetable oil made from it==, consumers are India, Indonesia and China
- used for cooking food as a substitute of butter, alo in cosmetics, soaps and detergents as base material

### Environmental Impacts

- to meet production deforestation carried out in countries like Indonesia, Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Sumatra, Congo Basin
- Loss of biodiversity particularly Orangutans
- Climate Change due to deforestation
- use of pesticides and fertilizers esp Paraquat a type of herbicide
- Indian imports from Malaysia, Indonesia.
- AP is the higher producer in IN

### Major Constraints in Domestic Cultivation

- Geographical location not ideal ==best is 8Â° N and S of Equator==
- Irrigation requires regular rainfall, Long gestation period of 4 yr
- small farm holdings, limited investment by corporate sector

### Gov Plans

- Mo Food give subsidies for distribution of palm oil under PDS
- Oil Palm Dev program now part of Integrated #Scheme of Oilseeds
- Roundtable on Sustainable Oil RSPO estd in 2004 provides certification #body

## Colony Collapse Disorder CCD :

- population of Bees plummeting due to unexplained reason
- Causes could be :
	- Global Warming, parasitic infection, malnutrition, metal pollution, stress, habitat loss
	- ==Neonicotinides are nictoine like insecticides== : water soluble absorbed by pollinators from pollen and nector of treated palnts may be leading to dec
- policy decision to protect bees, reward farmers to protect bees, strengthen bee research, Integrated pest management

## Wildlife Deaths due to Collitions w/ Trains

- Art 51A, 48A
- Coordination b/w MoEFCC and Mo Railways
- demarcate vulnerable patches with signboards,
- Electronic tagging of elephants, leopards etc
- improve infra, posting forest officials in Railway control rooms for better coordination

## Impact of Radiation from Towers

- EMW generated heats up small birds due to low weight and higher surface area, lower body fluid, disturb their ability to navigate, collision leads to deaths
- In humans it causes psychological changes, genetic defects, fatigue, nausea, irritability, headaches

### Responsibilities of Stakeholders

- MoEFCC should notify impact to concerned agencies
- Regular monitoring by state and local bodies, carry out EIA before giving permission
- State Env and Forest dept take awareness measures
- DoT should avoid overlapping of radiation fields, location of towers be geotagged and be made public, refine standards on safe limit of exposure to EMR, precaution to minimise exposure

## Genetically Engineered Trees

- ==1st GE tree in Belgium 1988==, China has inculcated in large scale
- act as carbon sinks ==to help meet Clean Dev Mechanism under Kyoto protocol==
- Difficult to decipher behaviour of new gene in natural env; likely to contaminate vast expanse of native forest threaten ecological balance
- In Indian Rubber research institute dev 1st GET

## Steps Taken to Combat Air Pollution

- improved fuel, comprehensive policy for abetement of pollution
- tightening industrial emission norms, mandatory env clearance for specific industries
- air quality monitoring improved, assessment of pollution load, public awareness

The sun emits energy in what kind of wavelengths - High energy short wavelengths

 Q. About how much energy is reflected back into space?
 A. 30%

 Q. Which is the biggest overall contributor to greenhouse effect?
 A. Water Vapour

 Q. What is the largest emitter of Methane CH4 in the atmosphere?
 A. Wetlands

 Nitrous Oxide N2O is emitted by the use of **fertilizers** in agriculture, burning of **transportation** fuel, production of **Nitric Acid**.

 Fluorinated gases : They are non-ozone depleting gases but have very high
**global warming potential** GWP.

 There are 3 mains types of fluorinated gases :

- Hydrofluorocarbons HFCs - are used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, solvents and fire retardants.
- Perfluorocarbons PFCs - produced during Aluminium production and manufacturing of semi conductors.
- Sulfur Hexafuoride SF6 - used in magnesium processing, semi-conductor manufacturing and as tracer gas for leak detections. It is also used in electrical transmission equipment and circuit breakers.

 "Brown carbon" is generally referred for **greenhouse gases** and "black carbon" for **particles** resulting from impure combustion.

 Climate "**forcings**" are factors in the climate system that either increase or decrease the effects to the climate system.

 Positive forcings such as excess greenhouse gases warm the earth while negative forcings, such as the effects of most **aerosols** and volcanic eruptions, actually **cool** the earth.

 The power of a process to alter the climate is estimated by its "**radiative forcing**" which is the change in the Earth's energy balance due to that process.

 The factors that cause Ocean acidification are :

- **Acid rain**
- **Eutrophication**
- respiration of bacteria decomposing algae leads to dec. in sea water pH.

 Q. Events where deeper ocean water circulates onto continental shelves and near-shore areas are called?
 A. Upwelling

 The **upper** layers of the ocean tend to be supersaturated with CaCO3 so little dissolution takes place, whilst the deep ocean is undersaturated and carbonate readily dissolves.

 The first boundary between these two states is known as the lysocline.
