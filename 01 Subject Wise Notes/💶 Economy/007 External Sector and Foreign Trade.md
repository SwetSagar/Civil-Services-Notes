- All economic activity of an economy that takes place in a foreign currency falls in the external sector such as exports, imports, foreign investment, external debt, current account, capital account, BoP etc.

## Balance of Payments BOP

![[Pasted image 20220309192840.png]]

- includes all outflows and inflows ie payment and receipts. Various types are
	1. Balance of Trade (export and import).
		- It is the largest component of a countrys BoP.
	2. Balance of **Current Account** = **BO or Net Trade in Goods** (Export of Goods, Import of Goods) + **BO or Net Trade in services** (Net Factor and Non Factor Income) + **Transfer of Payment** (Gifts, remittances and Grants)
			- services are further divided into factor and non factor income. Factor includes earning on factors of production ie Land, labour and capital and Non factor from services like shipping, banking, software etc
	3. Balance of **Capital Account** = **Investment** (Direct investment viz FDI, Equity Capital, Reinvested Earnings and Portfolio investment ex FII, Offshore funds) + **External borrowing** (ECB, Short term Debt) + **External Assistance** (Gov AId, Intergov/Multilateral/Bilateral loans)
- BOP crisis 1991 - Gulf war and increasing oil prices, tourism dropped, rating were downgraded. Had to pledge gold to meet short term obligations, Rupee was devalued
- BoP equilibrium is when sum of current account and its non reserve capital account equals to Zero. This means that current account is entirely balanced by finances from international lending.
- **Autonomous transactions** : international economic transactions are called autonomous when transactions are made due to some reason other than bridging the gap in BoP. They are done with sole motive of earning a profit. They are not influenced by other transactions in BoP account.
- **Accomodating transactions** are those that are undertaken to cover deficit/ Surplus in BoP ie they are determined by the gap in Balance of Payment. They are determined by net consequences of autonomous transactions.

### Devaluation/Cheaper

- means more rupees for a dollar and Revaluation/Stronger is opposite both are done by Central Banks.
	- If it is done by Market forces it is called depreciation and appreciation respectively.

### Convertibility of Rupees

- It a currency is allowed to be converted into foreign currency for all current account purposes it is called full current account convertibility. Similarly for capital account.
- able to convert into foreign currency
- Rupee Convertibility in 1992 was allowed as 40% in official exchange rate decided by RBI and other 60% by market forces
- was called Partial Convertibility of rupee
- Under Liberalised Exchange Mgt System LERMS the dual exchange rate system is followed.
- Was made fully convertible in 1994
- Convertibility is different from Exchange in the formers there is always a sale or purchase of goods.

#### Tarapore Comm. 2006 on Full Ruppee Convertibility

- Improve regulatory and supervisory standards
- Ban on participatory notes as mode of investment
- Ease direct investment routes, NRI investor = Foreign individual investors
- Increase outbound remittance by Indians
- Control fiscal deficit
- Set up Monetary Policy Committee

### Current account Convertibility

- Current account is fully convertible this means that full amt of foreign exchange required by someone for current puroses will be made available to him at official exchange rate and there could be unprohibited outflow of foreign exchange rate. This was done after IMF deal.
- in BoP means foreign trade in physical goods, invisibles (services) and remittances.
  - Current account convertibility for exports, import of services, remittances
- **Current Account Deficit CAD**
	- Occurs when value of imports is greater than the value of exports.
	- To reduce this devaluation of currency, tight monetary policy and supply chain augmentation is done.

> CAD = Bo Trade (Export - Import) + Net factor income (interest and dividends) + Net transfer payments (foreign aid)

### Capital account Convertibility

- India is a partially convertible in capital accounts.
- Indian corporates are allowed full convertibility in automatic route upto $500 mil overseas investment.
- they can repay their ECBs upto $500mil
- Individuals can invest in foreign assets upto level of $250,000 per annum.
- Unlimited gold can be imported.
- Capital account convertibility means more FDI/FPI
    - More the convertibility stronger economy
- **CAC is regulated under FEMA**, steps taken to relax CAC rules
- Liberal FPIs and FIIs
- ECB does not require approval from RBI/Ministry
- Inflows are more liberalised than outflow to avoid BoP crisis
- Increased investments limits on MFs, Companies

#### Tarapore Committee on CAC, 1997

- Phased introduction, reduce fiscal deficit, keep inflation 3-5% range
- Reform financial sector, reduce NPAs
- Full convertibility means least restriction in capital and current account convertibility. 100% FDI and FPI in most sectors, liberal regime


#### Effects of Convertibility

 | Good Effects                               | Bad Effects                                   |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Causes more investment                     | Destabilizing                                 |
| Access to cheaper capitals by Indian firms | Unemployment in domestic industry             |
| Decrease in lending rate                   | Rupee volatility                              |
| Indian coys take over foreign ones         | FDI hike in defence can cause security issues |
| Macro-economic discipline                  |                                               |
| More diversification of portfolio          |                                               |

- **Dutch disease** : more investment leads to appreciation of currency dec in competitiveness of export and deindustrialisation

### Internationalisation of Rupee

- being able to pay in Rs for imports, exports, repaying bonds etc.
- Masala bonds, Currency Swap Agreements, being traded in global market etc are some ways to achieve.
- Currency needs to be stable, liquid, be available in sufficient amount
- Greater integration, helps reduce dependence on forex

#### Exchange Rate Depends upon :

- Growth rate of economy, future potential, foreign trade profile
- Inflation, Forex reserves, global interest rates etc
- Rupee is fully floated not managed by RBI, intervention is only when there is chance of instability internally and externally.
- Exchange Rate in India till was fixed till 1975 when it was delinked to British pound.
- Then till 1992 it was determined by RBI. From then it moved to a floating rate following a 'dual exchange rate' mechanism. One is the 'official rate' and the other is the 'market rate'. The latter determines the former.

##### Currency Mechanism

- Floating rate : Exchange rates are regulated based on market force of demand and supply. Domestic currency is left to free float against a number of foreign currencies to determine its own value.
- Fixed : Exchange rate was fixed by the IMF
- Managed Exchange Rate : mix of both fixed and flexible where govt attempts to exchange rate directly by buying or selling or indirectly through monetary policy.
- Dirty float : largely floated, bank intervenes to determine national goals
- Pegged : to international currency or to a basket of currency

#### Steps Taken by RBI to Stabilise Rupee Fall :

- Reduce outbound investment and remittances
- Encourage capital inflows
- Encourage exports and limit imports
- Using local currency for trade, importing oil etc
- International cooperation, curb speculation in currency

**NEER** : Nominal Effective Exchange Rate NEER of rupee is weighted average of exchange rate before currencies of India's major trading partners.

**REER** : Real Effective Exchange rate is when weight of inflation is adjusted with NEER

**EEF** : Exchange Fund Facility is a service provided by IMF to its member countries that authorises them to raise any amt of foreign exchange from it to fulfill BoP crisis but on conditions of structural reforms.

### Forex

- Total foreign currencies an economy possesses at any point is called forex.

> Consists of FCA + Gold Reserves + Special Drawing Rights SDRs + Reserve Tranche Position in IMF

- In Forex reserves most is Foreign Currency Assets FCAs > Gold Reserves > SDR + Reserve Tranche
- Problems with large forex
	- Cost of acquisition is high
	- Sterilisation cost is high. Sterilisation is form of monetary action that where reserve bank seeks to limit the effects of inflow and outflow of capital on money supply. Involves the purchase or sale of financial assets by central bank.
	- Market risks
	- Return is little
- Interest rates are high foreign inflows increases so does confidence in international financial markets.
- Sovereign Wealth Funds - fund of foreign currency invested in global assets. India does not have one because of inadequate forex, more borrowings.
- Sterilisation :
	- A monetary action/ intervention by RBI in money market to keep money supply stable.
	- Done through sale of fin assets to manipulate value of domestic currency relative to the foreign currency.
	- Ex. if RBI purchases foreign currency there would be less of it in the open market and an inc of Rupee. To offset this RBI would bring out gov bonds to suck out excess Rupee.
- Forex market is where currencies can be bought and sold is called foreign exchange market.

### Devaluation and Revaluation of Rupee

- [x] #todo
- In the [foreign exchange market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/foreign-exchange-markets.asp) when exchange rate of domestic currency decreases wrt to the foreign currency in a free floating exchange rate it is called Depreciation. Appreciation is when domestic currency increases in value.
- Devaluation and Revaluation are similar but they are done by the govt.

#### Effect of depreciated/devalued Rupee

- Good Effects :
	- Exports become competitive
	- FIIs increase
	- More money from loans
	- Non Essential imports dec
- Bad effects :
	- Giving back foreign loans become costly
	- inflation rises
	- Subsidy and Fiscal deficit rise

#### Effect of Rupee Appreciation

- Good Effects
	- Imports and Borrowing becomes cheap
	- Exports that require imported raw material become cheap
- Bad Effects
	- Profits in exports in general dec


#### Rupee Depreciation in 2018

- Dollar interest rates were raised led to flow of money to US
- US-China trade war, Turkish Lira fell
- Inc. in global crude prices


### Important Terms

- One of the policies of Trump is to oversupply dollars to weaken imports and increase exports
- To lower exchange rate money supply is increased or through OMO. Extreme form of OMO is called Quantitative easing
    - Also through expansionary fiscal policy ie spending more or cutting taxes
- Dollarization - currency substitution to dollar
- Currency Board - only controls the exchange rate of a country, specific function
- Global Reserve Currency - Dollar was till 1960s it was the only currency pegged to gold by Bretton Woods Agreement was changed later.

- **Flight of Capital** : when money rapidly leaves a country
- Capital Control done to control inflow or outflow of foreign capital
- Hot currency : if any hard currency is exiting an economy at a fast pace hard currency seems to have become hot.
- Heated currency : Term used in forex market to denote the domestic currency which is under enough pressure of depreciation due to hard currency's tendency of exiting the economy. Aka currency under hammering.
- Cheap currency : When govt starts re purchasing its bonds before their maturities money that flows into the economy then is called cheap currency. This implies lower/softer interest rate regimes.
- Dear currency : Opposite of cheap currency when govt issues bonds, money that flows from public to govt is called dear currency.
