## Definition of Economy and Economics

**Economy** : rational mgt of scarce resources it includes *equitable and sustainable distribution*.

- Economic activities are those that involve money.

**Economics** :

- study of human activity aimed at satisfying needs and wants; science of wealth
- how individuals, firms and govts withing our society make choices and how these choices determine societies use of its resources.
- includes production, distribution, trade and consumption of goods and services

## Branches of Economics

- **Macro** : study of economy as a whole, Keynes is father of macroeconomics.
- **Micro** : behaviour of individual actors ex consumers, producers etc
- **Meso** : in b/w macro & micro or specific sectors ex Automobile

 | MacroE                                         | MicroE                                  |
 | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
 | top down approach                              | bottom up approach                      |
 | tries to understand inflationa and growth      | deals with choices made by by consumers |
 | evolved from theory of how price is determined | from empirical evidence which existing theories could not explain                                        |

- **Econometrics** uses statistical and mathematical methods to economic analysis.

### Structure of Economy

**Primary Sector**

- transforms natural resources into primary products, often exploits natural resources.
- Ex fishing, forestry, agriculture, mining

**Secondary Sector**

- create finished product from primary ones, Manufacturing and Construction are 2 processes by which this is done.
- Further divided into *Light Industry* ie less capital intensive ex shoes, electronics etc and *Heavy* or more capital intensive ones ex auto, steel, petroleum etc.
- One of the largest employers and economies based on it are called industrial economy.
- Primary and secondary sectors together are called real sector.

**Tertiary or Services Sector**

- services are produced ex healthcare, education, banking etc.
- **Quaternary sector**
	- consists of R&D, Science and Tech, IT, IPR requiring <u>highly educated manpower</u>
	- sometimes included w/ tertiary and aka knowledge sector
	- defines the quality of human resources and economy has.
- **Quinary sector**
	- all activities where top decision are made fall into this.
	- CEOs, HODs in gov, Science, Universities, non-profit healthcare etc

## Types of Economies

**Market Economy**

- emerged from traditional eco system pioneered by Adam Smith.
- *Main ideas* were
	- that self interest motivates individuals this motivating factor was called the *invisible hand or animal spirit*. Social benefits were an unintended consequence of it.
	- To attain higher prosperity there should be a division of labour.
	- The invisible hand is determined by forces of demand and supply.
- System is regulated by competition and for efficient operation govt should follow a policy of *laissez faire*/ leave it alone.

| Free market Economy               | Capitalism                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| focused on exchange of wealth     | focused on creation of wealth and ownership of productive assets |
| solely based on demand and supply | private owners have monopoly on the market w/ some govt regulation                                                                 |

- *Problems* with this system
	- no tool to look after those with lower purchasing power
	- negligible absence of welfare actions
	- widens economic inequality

**Non-Market Economy**

- Rooted by Karl Marx ex socialist and communist.
- *Main ideas* were
	- resources were to be used for wellbeing of all and are best utilised under ownership of society/community.
	- no property rights to individuals; absennce of markets
	- no competition; major decisions by state of production
- *Problems*
	- created scarcity of investible capital
	- optimum usage of resource was denied since they were not driven by market forces
	- absence of property rights -> no motivation to work hard and internal decay.
	- mostly non-democratic poltites adopted it.

**Mixed Economy**

- a mix of both the above, first adopted by France
- *Main ideas* are
	- state and private sector both to have economic roles -> private sector to work with motive of profit and state to provide public goods.
	- these roles are not fixed and could be modified.
	- state to regulate economic system

**Liberal Economy and Neo-liberal Economy :**

- Washington consensus or free market approach of IMF was suggested to developing countries facing economic crisis.
- associated w/ free market, trade, privatisation, price regulation, reduce govt intervention
- Fiscal discipline, tax reforms, liberalisation of interest rates, trade, FDI.
- later came to be called as neo-liberalism, market fundamentalism and globalisation -> belief that markets can handle everything.
- it led to LPG reforms in various countries esp those that got WB or IMF aid.

**State Capitalism or Beijing Consensus aka China Model :**

- alternative to Washington consensus and refers to the policies that were followed by Deng Xiaoping.
- based on ideas of stable sometime repressive politics and high speed economic growth; liberal use of private initiative
- constant experimentation, peaceful distributive growth with gradual reforms and selective inclusion of foreign ideas.

**Santiago Consensus**

- core idea is both economic and social inclusion, harness the power of IT and partnership.

**Political economy**

> Concerns redistributive side of resources and sets framework under which economics operate

**Keynesian Economics**

- stimulate economy when in distress since free markets have no self balancing mechanism,
- post great depression ex Bharatmala stimulus

**Communist economy**

- complete ownership by state

**Socialist**

- large part of resource owned by state, more control by workers
- eg **Nehruvian socialism** : Basic sectors controlled by state, supports self reliance and public-private coexistence
- **Gandhian socialism** : locally oriented production, no automation through machinery, everyone should do bread labour

**Development economics**

- after WW2 ==aims at structural change==
- Focus of health, education, employment
- Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz

**Mercantalism :**

- maximise net exports, huge gold reserves
- currently it is accumulation of foreign currency

**Behavioural Economics**

- understand human behaviour
- emphasis on nudging behaviours

**Green Economics**

- sustained growth w/o damaging env also includes social well being
- Indices like Green GDP, Social Progress Index, Environmental Performance Index

## Measuring Economic Growth

### GDP

> total market value of all final goods and services produced in the country in a given year
> = National Private Consumption(C) + Gross Investment(I) + Govt spending(G) + Trade balance(Exports - Imports)(X)
> = **GVA + Taxes - Subsidies**

- focuses on where it is produced, care economy is not included
- it is a comparative concept as well as a quantitative concept.
- ==should be adjusted to seasonality while comparing growth during a time period==
- **Nominal GDP** :
	- valued at current year prices, does not account for inflation

	> = Real GDP x GDP Deflator
	- **Mo Commerce and Industry** publishes a depreciation rate/ wear and tear rate that is used by companies to calculate NDP -> this depreciation rate is used as a tool of policymaking.
	- NDP is uded for domestic purposes to analyse sectoral situation of depreciation in industry and trade and to show achievement in R&D to cut depreciation.
- **Real GDP** : calculated on base year prices, considers inflation ^1c427e

	> = Nominal GDP / GDP Deflator

- **Net Domestic Product NDP** = GDP - Depreciation
- **GDP Per capita** = GDP / Mid year Population ^311874
- **Aggregate Income** : total amount of income generated by all people, businesses and govt in a country.

 > = Employee Income + Business owner income + Rental Income + Corporate Income + Interest Income + Gov Income - Subsidies

### GNP

- focuses on who produces products

> GNP = GDP + (production by citizens abroad - what foreigners produce)
>
> Production by citizens abroad includes = **Private Remittances + Interest of External Loans + External Grants**

- Net Interest rate in India's case has been negative since it has been a net borrower.
- In India's case the net income from abroad has been negative dur to trade deficit and interest payment on foreign loans -> that *India's GNP < GDP*
- Open economies generally have GDP > GNP
- Uses of GNP
	- it is a quantitative and a qualitative concept.
	- enables us to learn production behavior and patter of economy
- **Potential GDP** is level of output that can be produced sustainably without inflating the economy
 - **Net National Product NNP**

	 >= GNP - Depreciation
	 >= GDP + Income from Abroad - Depreciation

	- This is the national income of an economy and the purest form of income of a nation.

	 >National Income = NNP - Indirect Taxes + Subsidies
	 >Per Capita Income = NI / Mid year population

 - **National Disposable Income**

 > = National Income at Market Price - Current Transfers payable to non-resident (ex taxes on income, wealth etc) + Current Transfers receivable by resident units (remittance etc)

 - **Personal Income** : part of National Income received by households. Households have to pay personal taxes on their PI as well as Non-tax payments like fines.

 > PI = NI - Undistributed Profits - Net Interest payments made by households - Corporate tax + Transfer Payments

 - **Personal Disposable Income** : part of aggregate income that belongs to households, they can either consume it or save the rest.

 > PDI = PI - Personal tax payments - Non tax payments

![[Economy-and-Economics-image1-00072296.png]]

**Cost and Price of National Income :**

- *Cost* is the value of total goods and services produced calculated at *Factor cost* or factory price or input price and Market cost
	- *Market cost* or Market price is derived after adding indirect taxes/ product taxes to factor cost
	- Since 2015 NI is calculated by CSO using *market price*.
- *Price* is either constant or current depending on the impact of inflation.
	- Contant prices does not include inflation whereas current prices do include inflation.
	- Current Price is aka MRP.

**Revised National Income accounting rules** :

- *Headline growth* rate is now calculated at <u>GDP at constant market prices</u>.
- Sector wise estimates of GVA is given at basic prices
- **GVA Gross Value Added** measures the contribution of a corporate subsidiary, company etc. to an economy. It provides value for the amount of goods and services that have been produced in a country minus cost of all inputs and raw materials that are directly attributable to that production.

> **GVA** at basic prices = Compensation of Employees + Operating Surplus/Mixed Income + Consumption of fixed capital + Production taxes - Production subsidies

> GVA at factor cost = GVA at basic prices - production taxes + production subsidies

> GVA = GDP - taxes on product + subsidies on products

- Need now is to shift to a chain-based method of calculating GDP from a fixed base method since it does not account for structural changes in the economy and weight assigned to economic activities changes annually.

**Factors of Production** :

- Primary : Land, labour, capital both goods and human; sometimes Entrepreneurship also included
- Secondary : Material, Energy (Fuel)
- **Factor cost** is actual production cost
- **Market price** is actual transacted price including indirect taxes
![[Pasted image 20210529111253.png]]

**Transfer payments**

- no good, service etc received in exchange
- part of personal income
- subidies to producers not considered as TP
- used for income redistribution
- diff from subsidies
- not included in calculating GNP

**Base Year**

- growth is measure from this year aka constant prices
- production of current year is based on this years price #concept
- Real growth then calculated by reducing inflation; whatever is left becomes the real inc of goods and services

#### GDP Deflator

> = (Nominal GDP/ Real GDP) x100,

- measures inflation in entire economy not only a special basket of goods
- not useful for policy making since it comes out once in a year

Hard landing and Soft landing

- sudden fall in economic growth that it reaches the brink of recession is Hard
- Measured slowdown of growth to make it sustainable is called Soft L

**National Income Statistics**

- CSO under MoSPI
	- releases GDP data, National Income and GVA data
	- Base year 2011-2012

**Need to Measure Eco Growth/ Benefits**

- understand potential of economy
- adjust growth rate to see if they are sustainable
- prevent inflation, reorient national goals
- targeted reduction of poverty, employment generation

Growth can cause inequal distribution of resources -> social conflicts and degradation of env

**Deficiencies in National Income Accounting**

- black money, unreported income not included undervalues country's GDP
- Non monetised economy viz Barter etc deflates growth
- Household, Social services, Env costs are not included

**Limitation of GDP**

- Does not measure intangibles like quality
- Economic, Social Inequality, Gender Disparity not measured
- Not measures sustainability of growth
- standard of living might not be measured appropriately

Advantages

- Measured frequently, widely and consistently

### Alternatives

#### Human Development Index HDI

- meant to measure development level of economies was first publisded in UNDP report in 1990.
- *Health + Education + Standard of Living*
	- Health is measured by life expectancy at brith.
	- Education comprises of geometric mean of 1. Mean years of schooling for adults aged 25yrs and 2. expected year of schooling for children.
	- Standard of living is measured by GNI per capita at PPP level in USD
- Goes beyond GDP to measure general well being of people
- Inequality adjusted HDI
- 2020 #report by UNDP ranks India at 131 w/ score of 0.645
- Human Poverty Index by UN to complement HDI

![[Pasted image 20220321155337.png]]

**Genuine Progress Index** GPI : deducts environmental loss, resource depletion, social costs like crime and family breakdown, ozone depletion, farmland

**Social Progress Index SPI**

- measures extent to which country provides social and env needs to citizens
- Social Progress defined as capacity to meet basic human needs, well-being, opportunity
- by NPO Social Progress Imperative

**Gross National Happiness GNH**

- 4 dimension are equitable socio economic development, promotion of cultural values, environmental protection and good governance.
- by Bhutan

**National Biodiverisity Action Plan** : asked to incorporate Natural capital or goods and services provided by biodiversity in National Income Accounting

**Stiglitz report of France aka Sarkozy's Alternative**

- economic indicators should stress well being, include domestic and charity works
- integrate complex realities like crime, env, health, income inequality

**World Happiness #Report measures Happiness Index published by UNSDSN**

- talks about causes of happiness and misery, policy implications
- takes into account issues like Mental illness, importance of ethics, benefits of happiness

**Environmental Protection Index EPI**

- by Yale ranks countries on the basis of priority env issues in 2 areas ie protection of human health and env consideration

**OECD - Better life index**

**PPP**

- number of units of a country's currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic economy as a dollar would
- allows to estimate exchange rate
- removes distortions of volatile market exchange rates

**Business Cycle** :

- Alternating period of expansion and decline in economic activity
- 4 stages Expansion, Growth, Slowdown and Recession (not necessary)

**Recession :**

- technically below zero growth rate for 2 consecutive quarters
- decline in investment, household income, savings, business profits, inflation etc
- Recession relapses after brief growth is called double dip.
- 2008 Great Recession and Subprime crisis due to reckless lending in real estate sector

**Depression**

- abnormally large scale unemployment, fall in availability of credit, reduced trade, investment etc

**Growth Recession**

- Economy grows at such a slow pace that more jobs are being lost than being added.

---
- Indian economy classified into 3 ie Agriculture, Industry, Services
- High income country per WB has income > $12,235 aka First World
- Least Developed Countries LDCs have per capital income less that $1035 aka 4th World
- **Opportunity cost** -
![[Economy-and-Economics-image2-00072296.png]]

- Closed economy : that does not interact with other economies. Savings and investments are equal here since the net capital outflow = 0.
- Open Economy : When nations savings exceeds its domestic investment its net capital outflow is +ve -> it means that nation is buying assets abroad. When domestic investment exceeds its savings net capital outflow is negative -> foreigners are financing some of its investments by purchasing domestic assets.
