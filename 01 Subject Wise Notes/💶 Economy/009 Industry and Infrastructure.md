![[1.3 Infrastructure, Liberalisation, Land Reforms in India#Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana UDAY]]

- Includes physical, natural and organisational structures.
- **Soft** infrastructure means social infrastructure.
- **Critical** Infrastructure are those assets which rest of the economy depends upon : ex Electricity, gas production, telecom, oil, agriculture etc.
- Urban Infrastructure
- Green Infrastructure
- Natural Infrastructure ex forests, agricultural lands, estuaries etc

**Recent Challenges faced by Infrastructure sector**

- Project delays causing high cost over runs.
- Delay in land acquisition.
- Scarcity of fund due to longer gestation period REIT etc has improved scheme but not by much.
- Weakness of existing PPP model
- Slowdown in economy since 2008 financial crisis

## Railways

- Challenges facing Indian Railways are Huge resources required for capacity creation and the limitation of public resources
- Focus is on prioritising investment in important ares like dedicated freight corridors, high speed rail, high capacity rolling stock etc.
- High speed rail project in partnership with Japan at a cost of Rs 140 crore per Km has been approved from Mumbai to Ahmedabad.
- Train 18 is Indias firs engine less semi high speed train aka Vande Bharat express.

## Roads

- India has the *2nd largest road network in the world* with 59.64 lakh km of road network.
- The NHDP is financed through a cess imposed on Petrol and Diesel for the purpose this cess is leveraged by NHAI to borrow more using bonds and short term overdraft facility. Loans from WB, ADB etc.

## National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre NCIIPC

### Various Types of PPP Models

#### Build Operate Transfer Model BOT or Build Own Operate Transfer BOOT

- Type of PPP.
- Initial concession of finance, design, construction, own, operating is given to a private firm.
- After a set time limit it is transferred back to the Public entity.

#### VBOT : Variable - Build Operate and Transfer

- In BOT model there is a chance where contractor realizes his investment and profit ahead of his contract period
- In Variable - BOT the contract is terminated in such cases
- Concession - it is an agreement of grant of rights, land or property by govt, corporation, etc. Here either the govt can pay the other party or vice versa as per various scenarios.

#### Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM)

- Introduced in 2016 by NHAI
- Govt contributes 40% of capital of project cost is paid upfront for first 5 years through annual payment.
- while remaining 60% of the cost is paid over the life of the project on the basis of the assets created and performance of the developer.
- Gov pays only 40% so developer has to find the remaining 60% in form of equity or loans.
- No right of toll for the developer. Revenue collection is the responsibility of NHAI.
- Developer bears the construction and maintenance risks similar to BOT-Toll.
- Gov wants to use this in stalled projects where other models are not applicable.
- In BOT model if there is a low realisation of tariffs the contract would still be terminated and lead to loss for the concessionaire, it also led to building of NPAs, risks were unevenly distributed among Public and Private parties.

#### Toll Operate Transfer (TOT)

- Toll highways operated by NHAI for more than 2 years
- Auctioned to private player whoever bids the highest to operate(collect toll) and maintenance
- Highways are bundled out and given to offset the risks

#### Swiss Challenge

- A third party is asked to match the previous proposal, expert committee decides on which is the best proposal
- Advantages :
	- Efficient use of capital, speeds up process
	- Good citizen services, transparency
	- Genuine competition, cost saving for gov
- Disadvantages :
	- Politics-business nexus does not let real competition
	- Chances of large scale corruption
- Kelkar committee discouraged it
- Viability Gap Funding : one time grant is given for projects that have economic viability but financial support is missing. Ex UDAN

#### Take out Financing

- loan on a property will be paid back over a long period which replaces a short term loan .
- Done to address Asset-Liability mismatch
- Expand sources of finance for infra projects

#### Plug and Play Model

- Companies can start implementing projects immediately without worrying about all regulatory clearances
- Done for big projects
- Help attract foreign and domestic investment

#### Infrastructure Debt Fund IDF

- Have long payback periods are capital intensive
- Financed by NBFCs, present bond market lacks depth which limits its effectiveness
- IDF can be structured either as a trust would be managed by SEBI or as a company managed by RBI
- Infra Investment Trust InvITs

#### Design-Build/ Engineering, Procurement, Construction EPC/ Turnkey

- Contractor designs and builds the facility for an upfront payment of fees.

#### Lease -

- Operator is responsible for operating and maintaining infra facility but not required to make any large investment
- Used with other models like BOT, Gov bears the investment risk

#### Suitability and Selection of Model

- PPPs can be complex
- Creation of a SPV Special Purpose Vehicle is a key feature - it is a legal entity that undertakes a project and negotiates contract agreements with other parties
	- Their funds cannot be diverted
	- Helps bring together of other investors, sharing risks

#### PPP in Various Sectors

- PPP in ports has been encouraged, FDI is 100% automatic route
- To attract investment/PPP in social sector reimbursement of service cost will help reduce time and cost over-runs, inc efficiency, improve quality
- PPP in education - 20 IITs were to be established in this model
    - Criticismprivatisation of education and dilution of the role of the govt
- PPP in Health Care Services -
    - National Health Policy 2017 advocates PPP
