## Tropospheric Pollution

- It is a type of Atmospheric pollution.
- Troposphere is region of strong air movement and cloud formation.
- Gaseous air pollutants are oxides of sulphur, nitrogen and carbon, hydrogen sulphide, hydrocarbons, ozone and other oxidants.
- particulate matters are dust, mist, fumes, smoke, smog etc.
- **Oxides of Sulphur** : High conc of $SO_2$ causes stiffness of flower buds and its eventually falling from the plant. But the presence of particulate matter catalyses $SO_2$ to $SO_3$.
- **Oxides of Nitrogen** : High conc of $NO_2$ damage leaves of plants and retard the rate of photosynthesis. It is a lung irritant causing respiratory problems in children, harmful to living tissues along with verious textile fibres and metals.
- **Hydrocarbons** : Are carcinogenic also causes againg, breakdown of tissues and shedding of leaves, flowers and twigs in plants.
- **Oxides of Carbon** : $CO$ is mainly released by automobiles, domestic fuel etc. They bind with haemoglobin to form Carboxyhaemoglobin when this reaches 3-4% oxygen carrying capacity of blood is greatly reduced.
	- **Carbon Dioxide** : $CO_2$ is confined only to troposphere forms 0.03% of total vol of atmosphere. Causes global warming.
	- Global warming is when gases such as $CO_2$, $CH_4$, CFCs, $O_3$, Nitrous oxide, water vapour etc. traps the heat that is radiated back by the Earth increasing its temp.
	- [[3.1 Climate Change and Impact on India#Acid Rain]]
- **Particulate Pollutants** : minute solid particles or liquid droplets. Viable pollutants are bacteria, fungi, moulds, algae etc.
	- Non viable are smoke, dust over 1 mico meter in diameter ex pulverised coal, cement and fly ash from factories. Mists that are produced by particles of spray liquids and condensation of vapurs in air.

## Stratospheric Pollution

- Another type of Atmospheric pollution.
