---
- Most of the coal formed in the Carboniferous age 350mya.
- classified based on the amount of Carbon, **Oxygen** and **Hydrogen** present.
- Other constituents ==Nitrogen, Ash and Sulphur==.
- Undesirable are ==chlorine and sodium==.

## Peat

- Contains less than ==40 to 55 ==% carbon
- Contains sufficient volatile matter and lots of moisture
- Niligiri hill, Kashmir, WB.

## Lignite

- Contains ==25 to 30 ==% carbon.
- Moisture content is high (over 35 per cent)
- undergoes ==spontaneous combustion== leading to fire accidents in mines.
- found in Rajasthan, Lakhimpur (Assam), and Neyveli in TN

## Bituminous

- with ==40 to 80== % carbon
- Moisture and volatile content are low (15 to 40 per cent)
- does NOT have traces of original vegetable material.

## Anthracite

- with 80 to 95 per cent carbon
- burns with a short blue flame
- and is found only in J&K

## Location

- Carboniferous coal is 350 myo
- Gondwana 250 myo makes up 98% of reserves 99% of production in India, Carbon content is less
	- Damuda is lower Gondwana 80% production
	- Coking, non-coking, bituminous coals obtained
	- Anthracite generally not found in G coal
	- Free from **moisture**, but contains ==Sulphur and Phosphorous==.
	- 1st Coal mine in **Raniganj** WB, 3rd largest producer after CN, USA. Employs 7 lakh.

- Singareni and Kothagudam coal fields near Godavari river in Andhra P - non coking variety
- Wardha, Wun and Kamptee in Maharashtra
- Tertiary Coal 15-60 myo
    - Low carbon, high moisture and sulphur
    - Makum coalfield in Assam for making liquid fuel
    - Namchik, Namrup in Arunachal
    - Garo, Khasi and Jaintia in Meghalaya
    - Areas of J&K, Himachal P
- Problems
    - Uneven distribution, high ash content, low caloric value, underground mining, losses due to fire, bad transport infra, unscientific extraction
- Need
    - Blend high and low quality coal, coking coal only used for metallurgy, discourage selective mining, alternative energy source
- Coking/Metallurgical coal - coke vs Steaming/Thermal coal
