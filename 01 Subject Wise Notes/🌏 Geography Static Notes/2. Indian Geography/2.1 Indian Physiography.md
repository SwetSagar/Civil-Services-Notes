## Location

- Subcontinent has Hindukush and Suleiman Ranges towards the North West.
- Sri Lanka is separated from India by the ==Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait==.

## Structure and Physiography : Division into 3 Geologic Regions.

### Peninsular Block :

- Delhi ridge in NW, Rajmahal hills in East, Gir in west and Cardamon in South is the outer extent
- ==Karbi Anglong , Meghalaya Plateau== and Rajasthan are the extensions of the Peninsular block
- north eastern India is separated from Chotatnagpur plateau by **Malda Fault**.
- formed of gneisses and granites.
- Rift valleys found in areas around Narmada, Tapi, Mahanadi, Satpura.
- Mountains are residual, River valleys shallow.

### Himalayas :

- Young, weak and flexible in geologic structure
- techtonic in origin
- features like Gorges, V shaped valleys, rapids, waterfalls are common

### Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra Plain

- gradually filled by sediments

## Physiography or Physiographic Division

- Physiograhy : outcome of structure, process, and stage of development

### Northern and North Eastern Mountains :

- consists of Himalayas and NE mountains.
- important ranges are Great Himalayan consisting of Trans. Himalayas and Great Himalayas, Middle Himalayas and Shivaliks.

#### Sub Divisons of H

#### Kashmir/ North Western Him

- comprises of Karakoram, Ladakh, Zaskar, Pir Panjal.
- Baltoro, Siachen imp glaciers .
- famous **Karewa** formations of Kashmir for cultivation of Saffron/Zafran. Thick deposits of glacial clay etc embedded with moraines,
- Jhelum in its youth forms meander here.
- Southernmost part has dun formation ex ==Jammu and Pathankot== dun.

#### Himachal and Uttaranchal Him

- b/w ==Ravi and Kali== rivers
- Lesser Him locally known as **Dhaoladhar** in HP and **Nagtibha** in Ukhand.
- distinguishing features are ==Shiwalik and Dun== formations ex Chandigarh-Kalka dun, Nalagarh dun.
- Bhotia tribes migrate to Bugyals/summer grasslands during winter.

#### Darjeeling and Sikkim Him

- have **duar** formations no Shiwalik; fast flowing rivers viz Tista.
- **Lepcha** tribes inhabit high reaches
- thick soil cover, high organic content, distributed rainfall, mild winters make it apt for Tea plantation.

#### Arunachal Him

- Extend upto **Diphu pass** in the East
- imp peaks are Kangtu, Namcha Barwa.
- fast flowing rivers form deep gorges.

#### Eastern Hills and Mountains.

- low hills, tribes practice Jhum cultivation.
- Barak imp river tributary of Meghna which itself is a tributary of Chindwin.
- Mizoram known as ==Molassis basin== due to soft unconsolidated deposits.

### Nothern Plain

- dept of alluvium is 1000-2000 mts

**Bhabhar**

- narrow belt b/w 8-10 km parallel to Shiwalik
- rivers deposity heavier loads ex boulders, blocks etc and disappear in this zone

**Terai**

- South of the Bhabhar; 10-20km in width
- streams, rivers re-emerge here making it marshy and swampy
- rich in natural vegetation and wild life ![[Indian-Geography-image1-00091255.jpg|500x300]]

**Alluvial plains**

- **Khadar** : new alluvium that is deposited by floods annually enriches the soil by depositing silt.
	- They are found in flood plains and deltas.
	- It is sandy and light in colour and contains Kankars or calcareous concretions.
	- They become loamy and clayey in lower and middle Ganga plain and Brahmaputra valley.
- **Bhangar** : Old alluvial deposit that is deposited away from the flood plains.
	- It is found on higher side of the river valleys ie 25 mt above flood level.
- features viz sand bars, meanders, ox-bow lakes, braided channels.

### Peninsular Plateau

![[#Peninsular Block]]

- made up of series of **patlant** plateaus.
- general elevation/slopes from ==West to East==. ?
- Imp physiographic features like Tors, Block Mountains, Rift Valleys, Spurs, Dykes etc are present.
- Ravines found at Chambal, Bhind, Morena.
- Divided into 3 broad groups
	- **Deccan Plateau** :
		- Bordered by Western Ghats in West and South, Eastern Ghats, ==Satpura, Maikal and Mahadeo== hills in North
		- WG are locally known as Sahyadri in Maha, Nilgiri in Ktaka and TN, Annamalai and Cardamom hills in Kerala.
			- their height inc from North to West.
			- most peninsular rivers originate here.
	- **Central Highlands** :
		- Bounded by Aravalli in west, Satpura in south.
		- 600-900 mts above sea level.
		- ==metamorphic rocks== present.
		- Eastern extent is formed by Rajmahal hills.
	- **North Eastern Plateau** :
		- Extension of main Peninsular Plateau called Meghalaya and Karbi Anglong Plateau.
		- Meghalaya plateau divided into Garo, Khasi, Jaintia Hills
		- Receives max rainfall from SW monsoon

### Indian Desert

- longitudnal dunes, barchans, mushroom rocks, shifting dunes, Oasis are some features present.
- Northern part slopes towards Sindh, Southern towards Rann of Kachchh.
- Rivers are ephemeral, lakes and playas present have brackish water.

### Coastal Plain

- **Western Coastal** :
	- submerged -> natural conditions for dev of port and harbours
	- divided into Kacchs and Kathiawar in Gujarat, Konkan in Maha, Goan and Malabar in Kerala.
	- Rivers flowing through this do not form any delta.
	- **Kayals** are distinguishing features in Malabar coast.
- **Eastern Coast**
	- ==Broader and emergent== coast, well developed deltas
	- but less ports due to continental shelf extending 500km into the sea.

### Islands

- Andaman and Nicobar islands are situated b/w **6-14** °N and **92-94**°E.
	- Ritchie's archipelago and Labrynth are 2 principle islets.
	- Separated by 10° channel.
	- Coral deposits, convectional rainfall and equatorial vegetation.
- Lakshadweep and Minicoy are between **8-12**°N and **71-74** °E longitude.
	- Separated by 11° Channel.
	- has storm beaches made of unconsolidated pebbles, shingels, boulders etc.

## Drainage Basin

- Flow of water through well defined channels is called drainage, ill defined channels leads to large scale flooding.
- **Catchment area** : river drains the water collected from a specific area called catchment.
- **Drainage Basin** : area drained by river and its tributaries.
- **Watershed** : boundary line separating one drainage basin from the other.
- Catchment of large rivers called river basin for smaller river, rivulets called watersheds.

### Drainage Pattern :

- **Dendritic** : resembles branches of a tree.
- **Radial** : where river originates from a hill and flows in all direction.
- **Trellis** : is when secondary tributaries join primary ones at right angles.
- **Centripetal** : when rivers discharge their waters in all directions.

### Drainage System

- On the basis of discharge of water : Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal separated by the Delhi Ridge.
- Basis of Watershed Major ones drain 20,000 sq km area smaller less than 2000.
- Basis of Mode of Origin : Himalayan and Peninsular.



#### Himalayan Drainage

- Perennial rivers, passes through gorges.
- **Kosi** is called sorrow of bihar frequently changes its course.
- Evolution
	- Indo-Brahma mighty river traversed acroos Himalaya from Assam draining into the Gulf of Sind.
	- Disembered into 3 systems Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra due to.
		- Upheaval of western Him and the potwar palteau/Delhi ridge.
	- Down thrusting of Malda fault caused Gang and Brahmaputra to flow towards BoB.

##### Indus System

- Westernmost Him river, originates near **Bokar Chu** glacier
- tributaries of Indus include Shyok, Gilgit, Zaskar, Hunza, Nubra, Shigar, Gasting and Dras
- Flows only through ==Leh in India==.
- Jhelum rises from a spring at **Verinag** near Pir Panjal
- Chenab formed by 2 springs **Chandra** and **Bhaga** is largest tributary of Indus
- Ravi rises west of Rohtang pass in **Kullu hills**.
- **Beas** originates from Beas Kund near Rohtang pass.
- Satluj originates in Rakas lake near Mansarovar in Tiber
	- passes through **Shipki La** pass and feeds **Bhakra Nangal Project**.

#### Peninsular Drainage

- Evolution :
	- Subsidence of western flank -> its submergence below sea
	- Upheaval of Himalayas and subsequent subsidence of Northern Peninsular block -> this is where Narmada and Tapi flow.
	- Tilting of Peninsular block from the **Northwestern to Southeastern** direction
- older; forms broad, graded shallow valleys
- Fixed course, absence of meanders, non perennial flow.
- **Mahanadi** rises near Sihawa in Raipur.
- Godavari aka Dakshin Ganga rises near Nashik, heavy floods in lower reaches where it forms gorge.
- **Krishna** rises near Mahabaleshwar, Koyna is lesser known tributary.
- **Kaveri** rises near the Brahmagiri hills of Kodagu.
- **Narmada** rises in the Amarkantak plateau.
- **Tapi** originates from Multai in MP.
- **Luni** originates near Pushkar, ephemeral.
- **Juari** is a river in Goa; Ponnani aka Bharatphuzha is largtest river of Kerala.
<p></p>
- Western cyclonic disturbances originate in the Mediterranean sea are brought into India by ==the westerly jet stream==.
- When ITCZ shifts northwards the ==westerly jet stream withdraw== from the North Indian plain.
- An easterly jet stream flows over the ==southern part of the Peninsula in June== maximum speed of 90 km per hour.
	- do not extend north of 30deg.
	- are responsible for the burst in monsoon in India.
- Most of the rainfall in the Western Ghats is orographic. It depends upon 2 factors :
	- Offshore meteorological conditions.
	- Position of equatorial jet stream along the eastern coast of Africa.

The break in monsoon is caused by :

- Rain bearing clouds are not very frequent along the ITCZ.
- Winds blow parallel to the coast.

Rainfall in India does not occur in the winter due to :

- Winds moving from land to sea do not have **moisture**.
- Anti-cyclonic circulation on the land.

Local Storms of hot weather :

| **Name of Storm** | **Place**                |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Mango Showers     | Kerala and Karnataka |
| Blossom Showers   | Kerala                   |
| Kal Baisakhi      | Bengal and Assam         |
| Bardoli Chheerha  | Assam                    |

Tamil Nadu does not get rainfall during the monsoon seasons is because :

- Parallel to Bay of Bengal branch
- rainshadow area of Arabian sea branch

October heat is cause due to :

- clear skies and rise of temp due to retreating monsoon.
- High humidity

## Indian Monsoon

- period from June to September is called as Southwest Monsoon period.
- Factors influencing SW Monsoon are :
	1. Differential heating and cooling of land and water creates low pressure on landmass of India while seas experience high pressure.
	2. ITCZ is where SE trade and NE trade winds meet its shifting influences rain too.
	3. Presence of high pressure area east of Madagascar ie 20deg South also affects Monsoon rains.
	4. Heating of Tibetan plateau causes clockwise circulation in middle troposphere that develops into easterly jet stream. This intense heating positively correlates well with Indian monsoon.
	5. ENSO : La Nina would cause better mosoon in India and drought in South America and El Nino would cause drought like conditions and dec in rainfall in India.
