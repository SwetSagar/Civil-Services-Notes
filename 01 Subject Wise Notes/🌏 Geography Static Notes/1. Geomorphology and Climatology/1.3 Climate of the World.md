## Solar Radiation, Heat Balance and Temperature

### Solar Radiation

- Earth's surface receives most of its energy in **short** wavelengths aka incoming solar radiation or insolation
- Earth is farthest from the sun (152 million km) on 4th July this position is called the **aphelion**.
- On 3rd January, the earth is the nearest to the sun this is called the **perihelion**.

#### Factors that Cause Variability in Insolation Are

- rotation of earth on its axis
- Angle of inclination of sun's rays
- length of the day
- transparency of atmosphere
- Landforms eg Mountain, plains etc.
- Maximum insolation is received by **subtropical deserts** due to ==absence of cloudiness==. Equator receive comparitively less insolation, least on the poles.

### Heating and Cooling of Atmosphere

- Earth reflects in long wave form which heats up the atmosphere this process is called terrestrial radiation : it is 51% of the total radiation that reaches it.
- Convection is vertical heating, ==confined only to troposphere==.
- The transfer of heat through horizontal movement of air is called as **advection** ex **Loo**.
- Insolation more over continent than over oceans at similar latitudes.
- Earth as a whole does not accumulate or loose heat, maintains its temp.
	- The reflected amount of radiation is about **64**% it is called the **albedo** of the earth. #important
- Rate of dec of temp is 6.5 C per 1000mts.
- Effect of land is pronounced in Northern Hemisphere, vice versa is true for oceans in Southern H.

#### Inversion of Temperature

- temp inc w/ inc in elevation but is only for a 	short duration.
- requires long winter nights, clear skies; common in ==polar areas==.
- Heat is radiated during night by morning earth is cooler than air above.
- Surface inversion takes place due to accumulation of dust.
- in hills cold air moves down slope -> cooling of valleys aka air drainage.

### Atmospheric Circulation and Weather System

- The pressure decreases by about **1** mb for each **10**m inc in elevation
- Vertical pressure is greater than Horizontal but is balanced by gravitational force
- Near Equator seal level pressure is low called equatorial low
- Subtropical highs found along 30N and 30S; 60N and 60S subpolar lows are seen
- Pressure is high near poles called polar highs

#### Forces Affecting Velocity and Direction of Wind

- The horizontal winds near the earth's surface respond to the combined effect of :
	- **Pressure gradient force**
		- pressure gradient is strong where isobars are **close**, weak when apart
	- **Frictional force** - greatest at surface min at sea; affects speed of the wind
	- **Coriolis force**
		- deflects wind towards **Right** in northern hemisphere and **Left** in southern hemisphere
		- acts perpendicular to pressure gradient force
		- Max at the poles and absent at equator and is directly proportional to the angle of latitude
- When isobars are straight and there is no friction, the pressure gradient force is balance by Coriolis force and wind blows parallel to the Isobars called Geostrophic winds.
- Why cyclones are not formed near equators?

#### General Circulation of the Atmosphere

- The pattern of planetary winds aka general circulation of the atmosphere depends upon :
	- **latitudnal** variation of temp **pressure** belts
	- Emergence of pressure Belts
	- their migration
	- distribution of continents and oceans
	- rotation of the earth
- ITCZ is convergence of air/easterlies from tropics at 30°N and S
- Large scale atmospheric cell in which air rises at the equator and sinks at 30° latitudes(middle lats) are called **Hadley cell**
- Sinking cold air from poles and rising hot air from sub-tropical high forms a cell at surface called **Ferrel cell**
- The sinking cold air from poles blows towards middle latitudes forming a **polar cell**
- These 3 cells set the pattern of general circulation of atmosphere
- Seasonal winds like Monsoon, Local winds, Land and Sea Breeze are also influenced by the GPoCoA
- Valley Breeze : heated air from valley blows up the slope during day time; Mountain Wind : dense cool air blows down the slope during night
- Cool air of high plateaus and ice fields draining into the valley is called Katabatic wind

##### Air Masses :

- distinct characteristics in terms of temp and humidity ex Warm tropical, Maritime Polar, Maritime Tropical etc
- When different air masses meet the boundary zone between them is called a **Front**
	- Ex Cold, Warm, Occluded and Stationary
	- Occur in middle latitudes, cause abrupt changes in temp and rain

##### Extra Tropical Cyclones :

- dev in middle or extra tropical latitudes
- caused due to passage of fronts

##### Cyclones

- Conditions for the formation of tropical cyclones? #important
![[kegy210.pdf#page=7]]
	- **Large sea surface temp** > 27°C
	- Coriolis Force
	- Small variation in vertical wind speed
	- prexisting weak low pressure area/ low level cyclonic circulation
	- Upper divergence above sea level system
- Tropical Cyclones aka Cyclones in the Indian Ocean, Hurricanes in Atlantic, Typhoons in the Western Pacific and South China Sea, Willy-willies in Western Australia.
- Energy comes from Cummulonimbus clouds, moisture from sea strengthens it further
- Wind velocity highest in the eye, torrential rains occur here ^30e6d0

| Extratropical Cyclones               | Tropical Cyclones                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Have a clear frontal system          | absent                                           |
| Cover a large area                   | cover a much smaller area                                |
| Originates over both land and sea    | originate only over seas on reaching land they dissipate |
| Less wind velocity, less destructive | high wind velocity, very destructive                     |
| Move from West to East               | Move East to west                                                         |

##### Thunderstorms

- are caused by intense **convection** on moist hot days
	- is a well grown **cummulonimbus** cloud
	- Hails are formed when cloud reaches sub zero temp
	- Spiralling winds descend from severe thunderstorms towards low pressure area forming Tornadoes
		- generally occur in the **middle** latitudes.
		- Over the sea they are called **Water Spouts**.

## Water in the Atmosphere

- **Absolute humidity** : actual amount of water vapour present in atmosphere or weight of water per unit vol of air.
- **Relative humidity** : percentage of moisture present in atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature.
- **Dew point** : temp at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air.

### Evaporation and Condensation

- **Latent heat of vaporisation** : Temp at which water starts evaporating

#### Condensation

- water vapour -> liquid water
- direct conversion to solid water is called sublimation
- Causes :
	- cooling around hygroscopic nuclei
	- moist air comes in contact w/ colder object
	- temp reduces closer to dew point
- Influenced by volume of air, temp, pressure and humidity

##### Forms of Condensation :

###### Dew :

- ideal conditions are clear **sky**, calm **air**, high **relative humidity**, cold and long nights and dew point needs to be above the freezing point

###### Frost :

- Forms on cold surfaces
- Conditions of formation are similar to dew except **air temperature** must be at or below the **freezing point**

###### Fog and Mist :

- temp of air mass fall suddenly, hygroscopic nuclei are responsible
- Fogs are clouds formed very close to the ground
- Mist contains more moisture than fog, frequent over mountains

##### Clouds

###### **Cirrus**

- formed at high altitudes viz **8,000 - 12,000m**
- thin and detatched having feathery appearance
- always white in colour
- absorb more infrared than they reflect this process exacerbates global warming. Cirrus cloud thinning technique is used to counter this which cools the Earth #PrelimsPYQ
![[Climate-of-the-World--image2-00090827.jpg]]

###### **Cumulus clouds**

- look like a*cotton wool* and have a **flat base*
- generally formed at height of **4,000 - 7,000**m
- exist in patches and are scattered
![[Climate-of-the-World--image3-00090827.jpg]]

###### **Stratus**

- layered clouds covering large portions of the sky.
- formed either due to loss of heat or mixing of air masses of different temp
![[Climate-of-the-World--image4-00090827.jpg]]

###### **Nimbus clouds**

- **black or dark gray** in colour
- Form at middle levels or very near to the surface
- shapeless masses of thick vapour.
![[Climate-of-the-World--image5-00090827.jpg]]

###### Combination Clouds

- High clouds = Cirrus, Cirroculums, Cirrostratus
- Middle clouds = Altostratus, Altocumulus, Nimbostratus
- Low clouds = Stratus, Stratocumulus, Fair weather cumulus
- Clouds w/ extensive vertical development = Comulonimbus and towering Cumulus

#### Precipitation

- Besides rain and snow, other forms of precipitation are **sleet**  	and **hail**.

##### **Sleet**

- frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow-water.
- forms when a layer of air with temperature above **freezing point** overlies a **subfreezing** layer near the ground.
![[Climate-of-the-World--image6-00090827.jpg |300x200]]

##### Types of Rain

###### **Convectional rainfall**

- common in the summer or in the hotter part of the day
- esp in **equator** and interior parts of **continents**
- particularly in northern hemisphere

###### Orographic

- also known as the relief rain
- area situated on the leeward side, which gets less rainfall is known as the **rain-shadow area**

###### Cyclonic Rains

![[#^30e6d0]]

##### Distribution of Rainfall

- Coastal areas receives more, More in oceans than in continents
- b/w 35-40°N and S heavier on eastern coast dec towards west
- b/w 45-65°N and S first received in western margins due to westerlies

## Hot Wet Equatorial Climate

### Climate

- 5° to 10° S and N of Equator viz Amazon, Congo, Malaysia,
- Temp uniform throughout and No winter
- Cloudiness, Heavy precipitation, land and sea breeze moderates daily temp; annual and diurnal range is small
- Heavy rainfall ==150-250cm== peaks during equinoxes, no month w/o rain, distinct dry season missing
- morning bright, sunny → convectional, torrential rains
- Mountains show orographic/relief rains

### Vegetation

- is equatorial
- Tropical rain forest called ==Selvas== in Amazon
- Evergreen trees, palm trees, Climbers like Lianas, Rattans, Ferns viz orchids and Lalang
- Thick canopy, layer like arrangement height wise of trees
- Trees not found in pure stands of 1 single species → commercial timber exploitation becomes difficult
- Lumbering, Shifting cultivation have cleared rain forests, in Coastal areas Mangrove thrive

### Life

- Sparsely populated, shifting cultivation, food is abundant
- Tribes such as Indian tribes in Amazon, Pygmies in Congo Basin gather nuts, Orang Asli in Malaysia collect canes etc thrive
- Crops viz Tapioca, yams, maize, banans, groundnuts. Plantation are common ex. Rubber, ==Cocoa== esp in West Africa, Oil palm.
- High heat, humidity → physical and mental enervation, decreases work efficiency
- Diseases like Malaria etc, insects, pests common
- Lalangs are undesirable long grasses that choke crops
- Soils deteriorates rapidly, humus present makes it fertile but otherwise soil is not productive
- No grasslands handicaps livestock farming

## Tropical Monsoon Type Climate

- Found in India, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, North Australia, South China

### Climate

- Differential heating of Land and sea causes Central Asian land mass to be an intense low pressure area
- Whereas Australia winter making it a high pressure area.
- Winds from AUS blow as SE become SW after crossing equator
- During winter this condition is reversed and NE Monsoon winds blow

### Seasons

- Cool dry winters, Winter rains in Punjab is vital for Rabi crops
- NE winds bring rainfall to areas of Tamil Nadu
- Summers are hot and dry, SW Monsoons torrential downpour cools it → is characteristic feature

### Tropical Marine Climate

- Along Eastern coast of tropical lands ex Brazil
- recieves rainfall from Trade winds it is both orographic and convectional
- most of it occurs during Jan, Feb; no month w/o rainfall

### Tropical Monsoon Forests

- Deciduous trees, Forests have hardwood trees ex teak, sal, acacia, eucalyptus
- these forests often thin out to scrubland and savanna during summer

### Agriculture

- farming is intense, dominant occupation and mainstay of economy
- Rice most staple has 2 main varieties Wet and Dry paddy; rainfall required is 150cm
- Lowland tropical cash crops viz Sugarcane, Jute, Manila Hemp, Indigo, Cotton, Bananas, Coconut and Spices
- Higland plantation crops viz Tea, Coffee
- Lumbering is still carried out esp of Teak on the banks of Chindwin, Irrawaddy
- Shifting Cultivation is common done entirely for subsistence
	- Called Ladang in Malaysia, Taungya in Burma, Tamrai in Thailand, Caingin in Phillipines, Humah in Java, Chena in Sri Lanka, Milpa in Africa and Central America. #important
- Soils are mainly latosolic, leaching is rapid, easily exhausted.
