- Oceanic mountain ranges and deep trenches are moslty located near Continent Margins.

## Sea Floor Spreading Theory

- Evidences as proposed by **Hess** in *1961* are : ^4e69e9
    - **Volanic eruptions** are common around the mid oceanic ridges.
    - **Rocks equidistant from ridges show similarity** and the ones closer to the ridge are young.
    - Oceanic crust is younger than continental crust
    - Sediment in ocean floor are very thin and young
    - Deep trenches have deep seated earthquakes while oceanic ridges are at shallow depths

## Water

- Water Cycle :
	- Evaporation, Transpiration, Condensation, Precipitation
	- 59% of water falling returns to atmosphere by Evaporation

### Major Division of Oceanic Floor

![[1629895564.jpg]]

- Continental Shelf :
	- **shallowest** part, average gradient of **1deg** or less
	- Average width is 80km, Depth varies from 30m to 600m
	- longest shelf is Siberian shelf in Arctic Ocean stretches 1500km.
	- sedimentary deposits brought by rivers make them sources of fossil fuels
- Continental Slope :
	- gradient varies from **2-5deg**
	- Depth varies from 200mt to 3km
	- *Canyons and Trenches* are observed in this region.
- Deep Sea plains
	- flat and smooth, Depth Varies from **3km to 6km**
	- covered with fine grained sediments like silt and clay.
- Oceanic Deeps or Trenches
	- steep sides, 3-5 km deeper than surrounding
	- occur at bases of slopes along, volcanoes and earthquakes are common

## Minor Relief Features

- Mid oceanic ridge :
	- 2 chains of mountains separated by large depression
	- islands like Iceland are ex of mountains rising to surface part of mid-Atlantic ridge
- Seamounts
	- Pointed summits rising from seafloor that does not reach the surface
	- Volcanic in origin.
	- Flat topped seamount are called Guyots
	- ![[Pasted image 20220330110956.png]]
- Submarine Canyons
	- deep valleys similar to canyons on land ex Hudson Canyon
	- ![[Pasted image 20220330111126.png |500]]
- Atoll
	- ring-shaped reef, island, or chain of islands formed of coral.
	- Mostly found in **tropical regions** around a central depression

### Temperature of Ocean Water

Factors affecting temp distribution of ocean water?

- Latitude
- Contact of oceans with land : ex Ocena in Northern Hemisphere receive more heat due to more contact w/ land
- Prevailing winds : ex blowing from land causes upwelling by driving warm water away from coast, vice versa causes warm waters near coasts
- Oceanic currents

Horizontal and Vertical Distribution

- **Vertical Dist**
	- First layer : 500 mt thick, 20-25°C temp, always present in tropical region but only in summer in mid latitudes
	- Second layer : aka thermocline where temp dec rapidly, 500-1000mt thick
	- Third layer : extends upto ocean floor, temp change very slight
- **Horizontal Dist**
	- temp gradually dec from equator to poles, highest temp not at equator but slightly north to it
	- Avg temp fo Northern Hemisphere more due to more land area

### Salinity

- 24.7 is upper limit to demarcate brackish water

Factors affecting salinity of oceans?

- Evaporation and Precipitaion
- Fresh water flow from rivers, glaciers
- Wind
- Ocean Currents

Horizontal Dist

- land locked areas show higher salinity, even more in hotter regions
- ==Salinity in western parts of NH is less due to influx of melted water from Arctic region==
- Generally dec northwards but <u>North Sea has high due to saline water influx from North Atlantic Drift</u>
	- Baltic sea has <u>low</u> due to rivers draining in it
	- Mediterranean sea has high salinity due to high evaporation
- IN ocean avg salinity is 35ppm

Veritcal Distribution

- Inc at surface due to evaporation
- Salinity at depth is fixed
- Distinct zone in ocean where salinity increases sharply is called Halocline.

## Movement of Ocean Water

- Horizontal is Oceanic currents and waves

### Waves

- are energy not water
- features are crest, trough, height, amplitude (half of height), period (time b/w 2 waves), speed and frequency

### Tides

- Periodical rise and fall of sea level, attraction of sun-moon (more prominent) and centrifugal force is the cause.
- Movt of water by meteorological effects viz winds, pressure changes are called **surges**
- Tides based on frequency
	- Semi Diurnal Tides are most common tides
		- Has 2 high tides and 2 low tides
		- successive tides are of same height.
	- Diurnal
		- have 1 high and 1 low tide during each day
		- successive tides of same height
	- Mixed Tides
		- have variations in height mostly along west coast of North America
- Tides based on position of Sun, Moon, Earth
	- Spring tides
		- all three in straight line, occur twice a month
		- height is higher
	- Neap tides
		- Sun, Moon at right angles, counteracting each other
		- Occur after 7 days of Spring tide
- Ebb : time between high tide and low tide, when the water level is falling
- Flow : time between the low tide and high tide, when the tide is rising aka flood

### Ocean Currents

- have regular vol, definite path and direction
- Strongest near surface, slower at deeper depths

#### Primary Forces that Influence Currents

- Heating by Solar Energy
- Wind
- Gravity
- Coriolis Force
<p></p>
- Large accumulations of water and flow around them is called Gyres which produce large circular currents
- Difference in water density affects vertical mobility of currents #PrelimsPYQ

#### Types Based on Dept and Temp

- Surface Currents :
	- 10% of all water in ocena
	- upper 400m of the ocean
- Deep water currents : other 90%

##### Cold Currents

- usually found in the west coast of continents in low and middle latitude in both hemispheres -> causing aridity in the region
- in East coast at higher latitudes in **Northern Hemisphere**.

##### Warm Currents

- East Coast in low and middle latitudes -> results in warm and rainy climates
- West Coast at high latitudes in the Northern H -> marine type climate w/ cool summers and mild winters

##### El Nino #important

- El Nino appears once in every **3-7** years.
- an extension of warm **Peruvian** current.
- It causes :
	- Distortion of equatorial atmospheric circulation.
	- irregularities in the evaporation of the sea.
	- ==Decrease in phytoplanktons== leading to dec in fishes.
---
- Oceanic circulation pattern corresponds to E's atmospheric circulation pattern
- Air circulation in middle lats is anticyclonic more pronounced in Southern H; cyclonic at higher depths
- Mixing of Cold and Warm currents leads to phytoplankton growth, are one of the best fishing grounds

##### Indian Ocean Dipole IOD

- difference b/w temp of Bay of Bengal (Eastern pole) and Arabian Sea (western pole) → pressure diff this difference in temperatures is called Indian Ocean Dipole.
- Positive IOD is cooler temp in BoB and warm in Arabian sea; Opposite is vice versa. It brings more rainfall in the western Indian ocean region and cooling of waters in the eastern Indian ocean causing drought like conditions.
- Positive IOD causes above avg rainfall, results in more cyclone in Arabian Sea. It is favorable towards bringing Indian ocean.
- Negative IOD cause tropical cyclones in BoB
- IOD involves a periodic oscillation of sea surface temperatures SST between 'positive', 'neutral' and 'negative'.

## Waves and Current

- **Coastal landforms** depends on the *following factors *:
	- Action of the waves
	- Configuration of land and sea floor
	- Whether the coast is **advacning seaward or retreating landward**.

### High Rocky Coasts

- Long ridges of sand and/or shingle deposited on the beaches along the shore are called Bars
- Bars are submerged features *when they show up above water* they are called Barrier Bars.
- Barrier bar which get keyed up to the headland of a bay is called a **spit**
- When barrier bars and **spits** form at the mouth of a bay and block it, a **lagoon** forms.
- Lagoons would gradually get filled up by sediments from the land giving rise to a coastal plain.

#### Low Sedimentary Coasts

- Coastal Plains, deltas are common; lagoons, tidal creeks are occassional
- Lagoon first forms swam and then coastal plain

### Wave Erosional Landform

- Wave cut cliffs, terraces are common
- Wave-cut terrace are Formed at the foot of the cliff it is a flat or gently sloping platform covered by rock debris derived from sea cliff behind.
![[Coastal-Landforms-image1-00090325.jpg]]
- Sea Caves are formed by *Lashing and smashing of the waves containing rock debris against the base* of the cliff forms.
- When sea caves collapse the ***sea cliffs retreat further inland leaving behing resistant mass of rocks*** the are called Sea Stacks.
![[Coastal-Landforms-image2-00090325.jpg]]

### Wave Depositional Landforms

- Beaches: are formed by deposition, Temporary feature, sandunes are common behind a beach
- Offshore bars are ridge of sand lying paralled from low tide waterline to seaward.
- [[#High Rocky Coasts|Bars, Barriers and Spits]]

## Winds

### Wind Erosional Landform

- Pediments : gently** inclined rocky floors **close to the mountains at their foot with or without a thin cover of debris.**
  ![[Landforms-image9-00085771.jpg]]
- When pediments extends backwards at the expense of mountain from it gets reduced to an **inselberg**.
- The areas around it are knows as **Pediplains**.
- Due to gradual deposition of sediment from basin margins with mountains and hill, a nearly level plain forms at the centre of the basin, this gets filled by water forming a shallow lake called a **Playa**.
	- most prominent landform in desert, water retained only for short time
- Playa plains filled up by salts is called Alkali flats.
- **Deflation hollows** formed due to weathering away of the mantle of rocks by the action of wind.
- Deflation creates ***pits and cavities in rocks*** leading to the formation of Caves. ![[Landforms-image10-00085771.jpg]]
- Mushroom, Table and Pedestal rocks are some other forms

### Wind Depositional

#### Sand Dunes

- Crescent shaped dunes called **barchans**.
- **Parabolic dunes** form when sandy surfaces are partially covered with vegetation. The parabolic dunes are reversed barchans.
- **Seif** is similar to barchan but has only one wing or point.
- **Longitudnal dunes** form when supply of sand is poor and wind direction is constant.
- **Transverse dunes** are aligned perpendicular to the wind direction.
