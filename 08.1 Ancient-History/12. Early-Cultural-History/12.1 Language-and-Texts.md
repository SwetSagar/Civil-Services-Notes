- Apabhramasa represents last stage of Prakrit language
- Out of this modern north Indian languages emerged.
- Apabhramsa is considered to be a major source of the modern Indo-Aryan languages found in South Asia, including Hindi and other regional languages.
- Apabhramsa is considered to be the predecessor of the historical dialects Ardha-Magadhi, Shauraseni, Maharashtri, and ultimately, modern Hindi.
- Apabhramsa is known for its simplicity and clarity in comparison to Classical Sanskrit, which is known for its complex grammar and paradigms.
- It is considered to be the language of the Bhakti saints, with many hymns and poems being written in it, particularly in the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
- Apabhramsa has had a significant influence on modern North Indian languages like Hindi, Gujarati, and Marathi, as well as on other South Asian languages such as Nepali, Assamese, Persian, and Urdu.
- Another stage in the development of the Indo-Aryan languages was Apabhramsha ("falling away"), a vernacular of Western India which achieved literary form in the Middle Ages and was used by Jaina writers in Gujarat and Rajasthan for the composition of poetry. Its chief characteristic is the further reduction of inflexions, which are in part replaced by postpositions, as in modern Indian languages. A similar degenerate Prakrit was used in Bengal by a few late Buddhist poets, and is the ancestor of modem Bengali. [^1]
