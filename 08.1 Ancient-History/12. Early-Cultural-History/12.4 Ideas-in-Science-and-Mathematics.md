While it is true that Indian philosophy was rich in metaphysical speculations, it is also true that Indian civilization made significant contributions to various fields of pure sciences, such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, metallurgy and engineering123.

Some examples of ancient Indian achievements in pure sciences are:

The atomic theory developed by Rishi Kanada around 6th century BCE, which postulated that all matter is composed of indivisible atoms (anu) that can combine in different ways to form complex substances4.

The law of gravity discovered by Bhaskaracharya around 11th century CE, which stated that objects fall towards the earth due to a force called gurutvakarshan4.

The calculation of the earthâ€™s circumference by Aryabhata around 5th century CE, which estimated it to be 24,835 miles (close to the modern value of 24,901 miles)4.

The concept of zero and decimal system developed by Brahmagupta around 7th century CE, which revolutionized arithmetic and algebra5.

The Pythagorean theorem proved by Baudhayana around 8th century BCE, which stated that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides6.

The system of medicine known as Ayurveda developed by Charaka and Sushruta around 6th century BCE, which dealt with anatomy, physiology, diagnosis, treatment and surgery47.

The technique of making crucible steel (wootz) invented by ancient metallurgists around 3rd century BCE, which produced high-quality steel with carbon nanotubes6.

The science of architecture known as Vastu Shastra codified by Vishwakarma around 6th century BCE, which prescribed principles for designing buildings according to cosmic harmony7.

The concept of heliocentrism proposed by Aryabhata around 5th century CE, which suggested that the earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the sun[^7].
