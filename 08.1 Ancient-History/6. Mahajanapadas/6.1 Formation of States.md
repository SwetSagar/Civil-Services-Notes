- The emergence of Janapadas signified the birth of geography in Indian history. In vedic society people were not attached to one area.
- Villages. towns and clties were the units where the people lived.
- this was the time when kings and monarchs emerged. This was also the age of intense philosophical speculation. Buddhism, Jainism and many other heterodox sects emerged

## Sources

- The Brahmanas and the Upanishads were composed from 800 BC they mention many janapadas and Mahajanapadas.
- Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka tells about the social life of people.
- Jatakas dealing with the stories of the previous births of the Buddha are part of the Sutta Pitaka.
- Various archaeological evidences from Ahichchhatra, Ujjain, Hastinapur, Atraji Khera, Sravasti, Vaishal etc. They have given a distinctive pottery called NBPW.
- During the later vedic phase people took up agriculture and began to settle down, these places were known as Janapadas.
- The texts that mention about the Mahajanapadas are :
	- **Anguttara Nikaya**
	- Mahavastu
	- Bhagavati Sutra → not reliable

## Emergence of New Categories of people/ Society

### Gahapati

- master of an individual household which owned land, which became an imp form of wealth.
- Bigger one cultivated their lands with the help of slaves or hired labourers called the karmakara and Shudras

### Merchants

- **Setthi**, meaning 'a person having the best' is referred to in Buddhist texts.
- By the 6th century BC trade and merchandise became an independent source of economic activity led to the emergence of free peasants and merchants. Free from clan obligations of sharing surplus food or wealth.
- Concept of Private property had emerged.

### Ruler and the Ruled

- The rulers of this period ruled over their lineage and the notion of ruling over a territory had not emerged.
- taxes collected from the kinsmen were largely voluntary tributes
- There are references to Krsaka i.e. peasants who paid taxes to the king
- The Praja included people from the non-lineage groups also they were not related with kinship ties to the Ruler.
- Raids now changed into organised campaigns in which territory annexed and agriculturists and traders were forced to pay taxes.
- Bhagadugha collected bhaga i.e. a share of the agricultural produce. Survey of the agricultural land was done by an official called Rajjugahaka

### Social Life (Extra)

- **Jivaka** was the court physician of Bimbisara who also looked after Buddha.
- Villages - Gama/Grama was the equivalent to a unit of settlement in a Mahajanpada. In villages people generally pursued agricultural activities.
- Dasas, karmakaras and porisas were labourers. Villages inhabited by non-kinship groups also came into existence.
- **Kassaka** and **ksetrika** denoted the common peasants who were generally of the Sudra jati.
- The leaders of the villages were called Gamini
- Towns and cities dominated by Kings and merchants are variously referred to as Pura, Nigma and Nigama
- cities had emerged as the focus of power and control over the Mahajanapada

```ad-Answer

The relationship between economic growth, urbanization, and state formation in ancient India from the 7th century to 3rd century BCE is complex and intertwined. During this period, the development of agriculture and trade led to increased economic growth, which in turn supported the growth of cities and the formation of large states or "Mahajanpadas".

One of the key features of this period was the development of the iron age, which allowed for the creation of new tools and weapons. This, in turn, led to a growth in agriculture, as the iron tools allowed for more efficient cultivation of land. This growth in agriculture was one of the main drivers of economic growth, as it allowed for the production of surplus food, which could be traded and sold.

The growth in trade and commerce also led to the development of cities, as merchants and traders sought to take advantage of the economic opportunities provided by the new markets. Cities such as Kashi, Kaushambi, Panchala, and Magadha became centers of trade, commerce, and culture, attracting people from all over India. The growth of these cities was also accompanied by the growth of various industries, such as weaving and metalworking, which supported the local economies and created new jobs.

As the cities and economies grew, the need for strong and centralized political systems also grew. The development of large states or "Mahajanpadas" was a response to this need, as rulers sought to control and regulate the growing economies and populations. These states were characterized by a centralized administration, an effective system of taxation, and a well-trained army, which allowed the rulers to maintain order and control over the territory.

One of the most prominent examples of these Mahajanpadas was Magadha, which was located in the modern-day state of Bihar. Magadha became one of the most powerful states in India, with a strong central government, an efficient administration, and a well-trained army. The state was also home to several major cities, such as Rajgir and Pataliputra, which were centers of trade, commerce, and culture.

Another example was the state of Kashi, located in modern-day Uttar Pradesh. Kashi was one of the most important cities in India, with a rich cultural heritage and a thriving economy. The state was also known for its production of fine textiles and was a major center of trade and commerce.

The growth of agriculture and trade led to increased economic growth, which in turn supported the growth of cities and the formation of large states or "Mahajanpadas". These states were characterized by a centralized administration, an effective system of taxation, and a well-trained army, which allowed the rulers to maintain order and control over the territory.
