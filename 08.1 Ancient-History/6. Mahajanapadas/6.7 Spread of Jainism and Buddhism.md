## Rise of New Religious Ideas

- Vedic religious practices become cumbersome, elaborate, expensive, meaningless ceremonies.
- established the domination of the Brahmanas in the society
- new economic groups emerged, wielded more political power than before, opposed the position of the Brahmanas on the basis of heredity.
- Buddhism and Jainism did not give much importance to notion of birth it attracted Vaisyas to its fold.
- **Kapila, Makkali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambalin and Pakuda Kachchayana** had already highlighted the evils of the Vedic religions before Buddha and Mahavira but they were the first to have provided an alternate religious order.

### Origin of Buddhism

- Buddha was born to Suddhodhana of the Sakyas and Maya of the Koliya clan in Lumbini/Rumindei.
- saw an old man, a sick person, a dead body and an ascetic.
- wandered for 6 years learnt from Alara Kalama the technique of meditation and teachings of the Upanishads.
- resorted to self-torture to find truth, abandoned this went to Uruvela/Bodh Gaya and sat under the pipal tree attaining Enlightenment on the **49th day** of his continuous meditation.
- **first sermon at Sarnath** known as Dharmachakra Parvartana.
- **Asvajit, Upali, Mogallana, Sari-putra and Ananda** were the first five disciples/arhats of Buddha
- Kings like **Bimbisara, Ajatasatru (Magadha), Prasenajita (Kosala) and Udayana (Kausambi)** disciples and contemporaries
- age of 80 (486 B.C.) he **died at Kusinagara**

#### Teachings of Buddha

- Four Noble Truths
    - world is full of **suffering/Dukkha**
    - All **sufferings have a cause**: desire, ignorance and attachment are the causes of sufferings
    - they be **removed by destroying its cause**.
    - In order to end sufferings **one must know the right path** which is the **eightfold** path or the **Ashtangika Marga**.
- Eight fold path consists of -
    - Finding the right view
    - Right aim
    - Right speech
    - Right action
    - Right livelihood
    - Right effort
    - Right mindfulness
    - Right concentration
- emphasis on the **law of 'karma'** a/c to this present is determined by the past action. If the individual has no sin he is not born again.
- Buddha preached **'nirvana' as ultimate goal** of life it meant shedding of all desires and ending sufferings.
- Buddha neither accepted nor rejected the existence of God he was more concerned about the individual and his actions.
- He emphasized spirit of love, following ahimsa. An individual is to follow the middle path as both luxury and asceticism is to be avoided.
- His attack on the caste system and the supremacy of the Brahmins was welcomed by the people of the lower orders. There was no need for middle man to achieve nirvana.
- Buddha **rejected the authority of the Vedas** and **condemned animal sacrifices and meaningless rituals**.
- Buddhist teachings are compiled into Sutta, Vinaya and Abhidhamma Pitakas.

### Rise

- Apart from Sutta and Vinaya pitaka detailed hagiographies are contained in the **Lalitavistara**, **Mahavastu**, Buddhacharita.
- teaching were a way of life to reach salvation and thus was more than just philosophy.
- Core of his doctrine was the **Ariya sachchani** or Four Noble truths Suffering ie Dukkha, cause or samudaya, removal or nirodha and Atthanga magga Eight fold path the way of achieving this calle the middle path
- Another imp aspect of Buddhas teaching was **patichcha-samuppada** : expalnation of all phenomena and of Dukkha. The elements of this called **nidanas** were represented in a wheel.
- ultimate goal of the Buddha's teaching was the attainment of **nibbana** which meant extinction of desire. Parinibbana meant death.
- In Majjhima Nikaya Buddha uses the analogy of the raft to explain that the dhamma he taught was a means of attaining an end. #GS4
- Buddhist emphasis on ahimsa involved a critique of Brahmanical animal sacrifices
- monastic order of monks, and ultimately also of nuns, was created within the Buddha's lifetime
- Vinaya Pitaka gives an account of the estd of Sangha and rules that govern it.
- Vinaya Pitaka has two main sections-the *Sutta Vibhanga* â†’ that has Pattimokkha a set of rules and Khandaka. It regulated the monks and nuns and defined the relation b/w Sangha and laity.
- Members of the Sangha taught dhamma to the laity. For the laity giving dana/alms lead to accumulation of punya/merit.
- The male followers of laity were called **Upasakas** and the female followers were called upasikas. #PrelimsPYQ ^wz5yxe
- Buddha's doctrine was more socially inclusive than the Brahmanical one but it did not aim the abolishing of social differences. He saw social relationships as fetters.
- Buddhists considered varna as man-made ordering. Most monks in were either Kshatriya or Brahmanas belonging to families of high status.
- One of the reason for this was that there was internal dissension among the Brahmanical fold as not all Brahmans were ritual specialists.
- Monks could take food from anyone irrespective of their social hierarchy.
- Buddha's dhamma must have appealed to the laity because it offered a coherent code of conduct.
- Nibbana was possible for women too. Buddhist texts were stereotypical of the women.
- It was not open to pregnant women, mothers of unweaned children, rebellious women.
- Samyutta Nikaya refers to Khema and her discourse to king Pasenadi. Anguttara Nikaya about Dhammadinna. Therigatha consists of 73 poems and is supposed to have been composed by 72 nuns.

## Influence of Upanishadic Thought on Heterodox Sects

- [x] #todo
- What are Upanishads? What are Heteredox/ Nastika sects?
- Upanishadic thoughts are ideas, values and modes of thinking that have beginnings from Upanishadic texts.
- Birhadaranyak, Chandogya and Aitreya were pre Buddhist. Both Up and B texts believed in undesirability of worldly existence and wanted liberation from it. Both disregarded priestly rites and rituals.
- Monier Williams - Buddha was a metaphysician and had great sympathy w/ Up philosophy.
- Albrecht F Weber - Teaching in B is absolutely nothing new, is entirely identical and corresponding w/ Brahmanical doctrines.
- other historians like Ranade and Mahadevan say that they merge into each other.
- Oldenberg says not even one philosophy was known to Buddha.
- Identification of self w/ the world and not w/ one of the 5 factors of existence/Khandas seems borrowed from Up.
- Early Buddhists might not have been acquainted w/ Up.
