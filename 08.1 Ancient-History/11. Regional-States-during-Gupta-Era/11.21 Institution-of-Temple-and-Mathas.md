DN Jha :
-   emergence of temples as land magnates signified oppression of peasantry and growth of feudal agrarian relations
-   Became centre of political power, leading to decentralisation, Temple - King rivalry

```

- But relationship was of alliance and for patronage
- Merchants and Guilds donated sheeps, coins etc for the maintenance of temples like lamps etc
- Women appear as donor in all 3 religious traditions - Leslie Orr
    - Religious women like monks, nuns etc, queens, wives of landowners, chieftains etc donated
    - Active participation rather than total marginalisation
    - Devadasi women of 20th century was not the same as that during Chola period
    - Temple women made donations, mostly associated with small temple establishments, they did not marry, it was a privilege and honor for them
