Kalhana’s views of history were:

He believed that history should be based on authentic and rational sources, not on eulogy or exaggeration.
He aimed to write a chronological and critical account of the kings of Kashmir, starting from legends to his own time.
He considered history as a mirror of past events and a guide for future actions.
He valued history as a source of moral lessons and political wisdom.
He acknowledged his own limitations and errors, and invited corrections from future historians.

Principles of History according to Kalhana : 

History should be based on authentic and rational sources, not on hearsay or imagination1 .
History should be written with impartiality and objectivity, free from love or hatred for any person or event.
History should be chronological and critical, not just a narration of events.
History should reflect the culture and society of the people, not just the deeds of the kings13.
History should provide moral lessons and political wisdom for future generations

Mark Aurel Stein, a British-Hungarian scholar who translated Rajatarangini into English, praised Kalhana as a “true son of the soil” who had a keen interest and insight into the history and culture of Kashmir. He also appreciated Kalhana’s critical approach and use of various sources.

Romila Thapar, a prominent Indian historian, regarded Kalhana as one of the first Indian historians to lay down principles for writing history. She also noted that Kalhana was influenced by his own political and social context, and that his work reflected his regionalism and patriotism[^2 ^][ ^3 ^].

Nilakanta Sastri, a renowned Indian historian, admired Kalhana’s poetic skill and historical sense. He also pointed out some of Kalhana’s errors and contradictions in chronology and calculation23.

Robin Donkin, a British geographer and historian, argued that Kalhana was an exception among native Indian literary works for having a developed sense of chronology and place. He also observed that Kalhana’s work was more than a mere chronicle, but rather a “historical poem” with literary merit.

1. Evaluate Rajtarangini as a source of history. [2012, 10m]

```ad-Answer

Rajatarangini is a valuable source of history for several reasons:

It is one of the earliest and most authentic works of its kind that covers the entire span of history in the Kashmir region from the earliest times to the 12th century CE.
It is written in Sanskrit verse, which is a rare and remarkable feat for a historical chronicle. It also reflects the literary and cultural achievements of Kashmir.
It is based on various sources of information, such as inscriptions, coins, genealogies, chronicles and oral traditions. Kalhana also critically examined and compared these sources for their reliability and accuracy[^.
It provides rich details about the political, social, economic, religious and cultural aspects of Kashmir and its rulers. It also mentions some events and rulers from other parts of India, such as Bengal, Magadha, Kannauj, Gujarat and Malwa143.
It has been translated into various languages and has inspired later historians to continue the history of Kashmir. It also serves as a source of inspiration for poets and artists12.

Limitations of Kalhana's Rajtarangini as source of history : 

He was not clear about the dates and chronology of many events and rulers. He often used vague terms such as “long ago”, “after some time”, etc. He also made some errors and contradictions in his calculations1.

He was influenced by regionalism and patriotism. He exaggerated the glory and achievements of Kashmir and its kings. He also included some legendary and mythical figures as historical rulers, such as Mauryas, Ashoka, etc.

He was biased towards some dynasties and rulers, such as Utpalas and Jayasimha, whom he praised highly. He was also critical of some others, such as Loharas and Harsha, whom he blamed for the decline of Kashmir.

He did not have access to some important sources, such as foreign accounts, archaeological evidence, etc. that could have given him a broader perspective of Kashmir’s history.
