## Caurapancasika Style of Painting Introduced by Bilhana

- An example of the Chaurapanchasika miniature shows Champavati standing near a lotus pond.
- This miniature belongs to the N.C. Mehta collection, Bombay.
- It was executed in the first quarter of the 6th century, probably in Mewar.
- The style of the painting is purely indigenous derived from the earlier tradition of the Western Indian art and does not show any influence of either the Persian or the Mughal style of painting.

 ```ad-Answer

The role of the Rashtrakutas for the mastery of Kannauj can be understood in the context of the tripartite struggle between them, the Palas and the Pratiharas, which lasted for about 150 years from the 8th to the 10th century CE. Kannauj was a strategic and prestigious city in northern India, which was coveted by these three dynasties as a symbol of their imperial power and prestige12.

The Rashtrakutas were originally feudatories of the Chalukyas of Vatapi, but they rose to prominence under Dhruva Dharavarsha, who defeated his Chalukya overlord and expanded his domain in the Deccan region. He also invaded northern India and defeated both Vatsaraja of Pratihara and Dharmapala of Pala, thus becoming the first Deccan king to control Kannauj324.

His son Govinda III continued his legacy and waged war against all his rivals in northern India. He also conquered Kannauj and established his supremacy over it. He was succeeded by Amoghavarsha I, who consolidated his empire and patronized literature and art. However, he faced challenges from both Palas and Pratiharas, who tried to regain their lost territories324.

The Rashtrakutas continued to assert their claim over Kannauj under Indra III, who defeated Mahipala I of Pala and Mahendrapala I of Pratihara. However, he could not hold on to it for long, as he faced revolts from his feudatories in south India. His successors also faced similar problems and eventually lost their power to their former vassals, such as the Chalukyas of Kalyani324.

Thus, the role of the Rashtrakutas for the mastery of Kannauj was significant but short-lived. They challenged both Palas and Pratiharas for supremacy over northern India, but they could not sustain their empire due to internal conflicts and external pressures.

The contribution of Rashtrakutas to art and architecture was remarkable and impressive. They built structural temples, cave temples and basadis (Jain shrines) in various styles and designs. They adopted the Pallava (Dravidian) style of architecture, which consisted of features such as pradakshanapatha (circumambulatory path), mukhamantapa (entrance hall), sabhamantapa (assembly hall), antarala (vestibule) and garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum)12.

The most famous examples of their art and architecture are the rock-cut cave temples at Ellora, Ajanta and Elephanta in present-day Maharashtra. These temples reflect their religious tolerance and patronage, as they depict scenes and deities from Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The Ellora site has 34 caves, out of which 12 are Buddhist, 17 are Hindu and 5 are Jain32.

The most magnificent and splendid among them is the Kailasa temple at Ellora, which was built by Krishna I between 756 and 773 CE. It is also known as Cave 16, and it is a masterpiece of Indian art. It is carved out of a single rock, measuring about 200 feet long, 100 feet wide and 90 feet high. It has a pyramidal tower over the garbhagriha, which resembles a Shikhara or a mountain peak. It has elaborate carvings of various gods, goddesses, animals, mythical creatures and scenes from Hindu epics such as Ramayana and Mahabharata324.

The Ajanta caves are famous for their exquisite paintings, which depict the life of Buddha and his previous incarnations or Jatakas. They also show various aspects of ancient Indian society, culture, costumes, jewellery etc. The paintings are done with natural colours derived from plants, minerals etc.

The Elephanta caves are dedicated to Lord Shiva, who is depicted in various forms such as Nataraja (the cosmic dancer), Ardhanarishvara (the half-male half-female form), Maheshamurti (the three-headed form) etc. The most striking sculpture is the Trimurti or Sadashiva, which shows Shiva’s three aspects: creation, preservation and destruction

1. Do you agree with the view that the form and content of temple architecture in South India between c. A.D. 750 and 1200 were products of a specific economic and political milieu? [1994, 60m]
- [Art :](onenote:[[Growth]]%20of%20Art%20and%20Architecture&section-id={762B0AE5-2A23-4D1F-9D30-89664CBE1143}&page-id={59379BDD-BA65-467A-BD24-93DDC65F29D3}&object-id={B0AB4AE3-1118-4E5D-8572-AF5CD865C4E9}&B&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/bbc8be5bd337910c/Documents/History%20Optional/Ancient%20History/Part%20II/Regional%20States%20during%20Gupta%20Era.one) onwards

```ad-Answer

One view is that the form and content of temple architecture in South India between c. A.D. 750 and 1200 were indeed products of a specific economic and political milieu, which was characterized by the rise and fall of various dynasties such as the Pallavas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Cholas, Hoysalas etc., who competed for supremacy over the region and patronized different styles and schools of art123. According to this view, temple architecture was not only a religious expression, but also a political statement, a symbol of royal power and prestige, a manifestation of regional identity and culture, and a reflection of social hierarchy and patronage networks124. For example, some scholars have argued that the Chola temples were built to assert their imperial authority over their conquered territories, to display their wealth and resources derived from trade and agriculture, to legitimize their lineage and ideology through inscriptions and iconography, to accommodate their diverse subjects and sects through multiple shrines and festivals, and to reward their loyal vassals and donors through grants of land or privileges14.

For the view that temple architecture was a product of economic and political milieu, some of the arguments are:

Temple architecture reflects the historical context and circumstances of its patrons and builders, such as their political ambitions, economic resources, ideological agendas, cultural preferences etc. .
Temple architecture serves as a source of historical evidence and information, such as inscriptions, sculptures, paintings etc., which reveal various aspects of the society and culture of its time, such as kingship, administration, trade, religion etc. .
Temple architecture varies according to the regional or local factors, such as geography, climate, materials etc., which influence its form and style[1[2[4.
Against the view that temple architecture was a product of economic and political milieu some of the arguments are:

Temple architecture transcends the historical context and circumstances of its patrons and builders as it is based on universal or eternal principles and values such as beauty harmony order etc[1[2[5.
Temple architecture serves as a source of spiritual or aesthetic experience and inspiration rather than historical evidence or information as it evokes emotions feelings sensations etc in its viewers or worshippers[1[2[5.
Temple architecture does not vary according to regional or local factors but follows certain standard or canonical rules and norms which ensure its consistency and continuity

Another view is that the form and content of temple architecture in South India between c. A.D. 750 and 1200 were not merely products of a specific economic and political milieu, but also influenced by other factors such as religious doctrines, artistic traditions, aesthetic principles, technological innovations etc., which transcended temporal or spatial boundaries125. According to this view, temple architecture was not only a political expression but also an artistic expression. It was not only a symbol of royal power but also a symbol of divine power. It was not only a manifestation of regional identity but also a manifestation of universal identity. It was not only a reflection of social hierarchy but also a reflection of cosmic hierarchy12 [5. For example some scholars have argued that the South Indian temples were built according to certain canonical texts or manuals (such as Agamas or Shilpashastras), which prescribed the rules for temple design construction worship etc., based on metaphysical concepts such as Vastu (the science of space) or Mandala (the diagrammatic representation of cosmos). They have also argued that the South Indian temples were influenced by earlier forms or models such as rock-cut caves or wooden structures which had their own artistic merits or challenges

-   For the view that temple architecture was influenced by other factors some of the arguments are:
    -   Temple architecture reflects the religious doctrines or beliefs of its patrons and builders such as their conception of divinity cosmos salvation etc[1[2[5.
    -   Temple architecture serves as a medium or vehicle for expressing or communicating their artistic vision or creativity through various forms or modes such as sculpture painting music dance etc[1[2[5.
    -   Temple architecture is influenced by earlier forms or models which have their own artistic merits or challenges such as rock-cut caves wooden structures etc[1[2[5.
-   Against the view that temple architecture was influenced by other factors some of the arguments are:
    
    -   Temple architecture does not reflect religious doctrines beliefs but rather adapts accommodates different sects cults within same structure complex[1[2[4.
    -   Temple architecture does not serve as medium vehicle for expressing communicating artistic vision creativity but rather conforms imitates existing patterns conventions without much innovation variation[1[2[4.
    -   Temple architecture is not influenced by earlier forms models but rather surpasses improves them in terms scale complexity sophistication

The paintings are usually found in manuscripts or palm-leaf books called pothis, which are arranged in horizontal rows and bound together by cords.

Comparison :

-   Theme: Caurapancashika style is secular and depicts the love story of a poet and a princess, while Jain style is religious and depicts the Jain scriptures, legends and cosmology .
-   Colour: Caurapancashika style uses bright colours such as red, yellow, green etc., while Jain style uses delicate colours such as white, blue, pink etc .
-   Line: Caurapancashika style uses bold lines to outline the figures and forms, while Jain style uses fine lines to create intricate details and patterns[1[2[3.
-   Figure: Caurapancashika style shows expressive faces and erotic scenes of the lovers, while Jain style shows stylized figures and symbolic motifs of the Jinas (enlightened beings) and other deities[1[2[3.
-   Background: Caurapancashika style shows naturalistic backgrounds such as trees, flowers, animals etc., while Jain style shows geometric backgrounds such as circles squares triangles etc

Caurapanchasika : 

-   The Caurapancashika style of painting is also known as the Late Pala style, as it developed under the patronage of the Pala dynasty in eastern India, especially in Bihar and Bengal .
-   The Caurapancashika style of painting is one of the earliest examples of secular painting in India, as it illustrates a poem that is not based on any religious or mythological theme, but on the personal experience and emotion of the poet .
-   The Caurapancashika style of painting is influenced by both Indian and foreign elements, such as the Gupta and post-Gupta art traditions, the Buddhist and Hindu iconography, and the Persian and Central Asian motifs .
-   The Caurapancashika style of painting is remarkable for its realism and naturalism, as it shows a keen observation and depiction of nature, human anatomy, facial expressions etc. It also shows a sense of perspective and depth in its composition.
-   The Caurapancashika style of painting is considered to be a precursor of pothi format by some scholars because it uses a similar technique of dividing each folio into two parts: one with a picture and one with text. However, unlike pothi format where each picture corresponds to a single verse or episode, in Caurapancashika style each picture corresponds to several verses or episodes

The early medieval temple architecture of Kashmir can be traced from the 7th to the 14th century A.D., when Kashmir was ruled by Hindu kings such as Lalitaditya, Avantivarman, Partha and others1.

The Kashmiri temples are characterized by their distinctive pyramidal roofs, arches surmounted by pointed gables, columns of Hellenic type and stone carvings21. They show a blend of Indian and foreign influences, such as Gupta, Gandhara, Persian and Central Asian styles23.

Some of the famous examples of Kashmiri temples are:

Martand Sun Temple: Built by Lalitaditya in the 8th century A.D., this temple is dedicated to Surya (the Sun god) and is located on a plateau overlooking the valley. It has a rectangular courtyard surrounded by 84 columns and a central shrine with a pyramidal roof4.
Pandrethan Temple: Built by Meru Vardhana in the 10th century A.D., this temple is dedicated to Vishnu and is located near Srinagar. It has a square plan with four porches and a circular sanctum with a conical roof4.
Krimchi Temple: Built by unknown rulers in the 11th or 12th century A.D., this temple complex consists of four temples dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha and Parvati. It has features such as fluted pillars, trefoil arches and floral motifs

Mamallapuram, also known as Mahabalipuram, is a historic town in Tamil Nadu, India, that is famous for its UNESCO World Heritage Site of 7thand 8th-century Hindu Group of Monuments1. These monuments include rock-cut caves, temples, sculptures and rathas (chariots) that showcase the artistic and architectural excellence of the Pallava dynasty12. Mamallapuram was also a major port city and a centre of trade and culture in ancient times12. Some of the most notable monuments in Mamallapuram are:

Shore Temple: A granite temple complex built by Pallava king Narasimhavarman II (also known as Rajasimha) in the 8th century A.D., dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu. It is one of the oldest structural temples in South India and has a unique pyramidal shape with intricate carvings3.

Pancha Rathas: Five monolithic rathas carved out of single rocks, each representing a different style of temple architecture. They are named after the Pandavas (the five brothers) and their wife Draupadi from the Mahabharata epic2.

Arjuna’s Penance: A massive bas-relief sculpture depicting a scene from the Mahabharata, where Arjuna performs penance to obtain a divine weapon from Shiva. It is also known as Descent of the Ganges, as it shows the mythical story of how the river Ganges descended from heaven to earth.  As per one view, it shows Arjuna, one of the heroes of the Mahabharata epic, performing penance to obtain a divine weapon from Shiva. As per another view, it shows Bhagiratha, an ancient king, performing penance to bring down the river Ganges from heaven to earth31.

The sculpture is carved with intricate details and depicts various scenes and characters from Hindu mythology and everyday life. It shows animals, gods, sages, ascetics, hunters, fishermen, dancers and musicians. The most prominent feature is a huge cleft in the rock that represents either Shiva’s trident or the flow of Ganges. The cleft is filled with carved snakes that symbolize water

- Pallava Sculpture :
    - Pallava sculpture owed more to the Buddhist tradition. On the whole it is more monumental and linear in form, thus avoiding the typical ornamentation of the Deccan sculpture. The free standing temples at Aihole and Badami in the Deccan and the Kanchipuram and Mahabalipuram in the Tamil country, provided a better background for sculpture than the rock-cut temples. And the Pallava sculpture was monumental and linear in form resembling the Gupta sculpture. Although the basic form was derived from the older tradition, the end result clearly reflected its local genius.
