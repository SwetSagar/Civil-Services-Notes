## PYQs

1. Did the triangular conflict between the **Rashtrakutas, Gujara Pratiharas and Palas** create a political vacuum in northern India which facilitated the invasions of Mahmud of Ghazni? [2001, 60m]

The triangular conflict between the Rashtrakutas, Gujara Pratiharas and Palas was a prolonged struggle for supremacy over northern India, especially the region of Kannauj, in the 8th and 9th centuries CE. It involved three powerful dynasties that ruled different parts of India:

The Rashtrakutas, who controlled the Deccan plateau and expanded northwards under rulers like Dantidurga, Govinda III and Amoghavarsha I.
The Gujara Pratiharas, who dominated western India and central India under rulers like Nagabhata I, Vatsaraja and Nagabhata II.
The Palas, who ruled eastern India and parts of Nepal under rulers like Gopala, Dharmapala and Devapala.
The conflict began when Dharmapala of Pala dynasty tried to capture Kannauj after the death of its ruler Yashovarman. He was opposed by Vatsaraja of Pratihara dynasty, who also claimed Kannauj. They fought a battle near Monghyr (modern Munger), in which Vatsaraja was defeated by Dharmapala. However, Dharmapala could not consolidate his hold over Kannauj, as he was soon challenged by Govinda III of Rashtrakuta dynasty, who invaded northern India from the south. Govinda III defeated both Dharmapala and Vatsaraja in separate battles and occupied Kannauj for a short period .

The conflict continued for several decades with changing fortunes for each dynasty. Nagabhata II of Pratihara dynasty succeeded in driving out Govinda III from Kannauj and established his authority over northern India. He also repulsed the attacks of Devapala of Pala dynasty, who tried to expand his empire westwards. Nagabhata II is considered as the most successful ruler among the three contenders for Kannauj. However, his successors faced renewed challenges from both Rashtrakutas and Palas. Indra III of Rashtrakuta dynasty sacked Kannauj in 916 CE and Mahipala I of Pala dynasty recovered it in 920 CE. The triangular conflict gradually subsided as all three dynasties declined due to internal dissensions and external invasions by other powers such as Cholas, Chalukyas, Turks etc..

Thus, the triangular conflict between the Rashtrakutas, Gujara Pratiharas and Palas was a complex and dynamic phenomenon that shaped the political history of northern India in medieval times.

Political Vacuum :

The conflict weakened the military and economic resources of each dynasty, as they had to spend a lot of money and manpower on fighting each other for control of Kannauj and other regions.

The conflict also led to internal dissensions and fragmentation within each dynasty, as different feudal lords, subordinates and vassals rebelled or asserted their independence. This reduced the central authority and cohesion of each empire.

The conflict also exposed the vulnerability of North India to external invasions by other powers such as Cholas, Chalukyas, Turks etc. who took advantage of the situation and raided or conquered parts of North India.

The conflict also resulted in the decline of cultural and religious patronage by each dynasty, as they had less funds and interest to support temples, monasteries, universities, art etc. This eroded the morale and identity of North India.
