## Administration of the Satvahanas

- @ ministers were appointed by the King and it was not hereditary.

  > B D Chattopadhyay suggested that it is unlikely that they the Satvahanas would have been centralised state. The Maharathi and Mahabhojas would have had been local rulers.

- Coins suggested that these local rulers swayed in their loyalty. They also had matrimonial ties with the Satavahanas.
- The empire was divided into Aharas.
- Amatyas, Mahamatra, mahasenapati etc were official
