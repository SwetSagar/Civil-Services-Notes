Buddhism is a religion and philosophy which originated in ancient India and spread throughout Asia, becoming one of the major world religions. Buddhism is a central aspect of the culture and everyday life in much of Asia and its effects can be seen not only in religious institutions and spiritual practices, but also in social and economic organizations, political structures, and even everyday behaviours.

Buddhism encourages a peaceful and harmonious social life, with a strong emphasis on respect, tolerance and compassion for others. This is based on the principle of ahimsa (non-harm), which encourages a life in which all creatures, human and non-human, are treated with kindness and consideration. Even in war and conflict, Buddhists strive to uphold justice and avoid unnecessary suffering. Buddhism also places great emphasis on family ties, with a particular respect for elders, and encourages monks and nuns to stay connected to their families, providing a stable and loving connection to home even when away from it.

Buddhism provided in India a framework for a strong sense of social togetherness, which in turn provided a basis for social cohesion and economic security. As a result, many communities across India were able to rely on each other and develop a level of support system that ensured their success as a group. The values of compassion and respect towards all creatures also provided a powerful foundation for ethical behavior and social justice, leading to a generally equitable and peaceful society.

Despite these many positive aspects, Buddhism has declined over time in India for many reasons. A major contributing factor was the influence of Brahmanical Hinduism which promoted a hierarchical caste system and prioritized faith over action, an approach that clashed with the central Buddhist teaching of mindfulness and non-attachment. The arrival of other religions such as Islam and Christianity also had an effect, subsuming the majority of Indiaâ€™s population and weakening the unity among Buddhists. Finally, the rise of British colonial rule in India in the late 1700s spread Western ideals and undermined traditional religious communities and social systems, including Buddhism.
