## Foundation of the Mauryan Empire

- Maurya empire built on foundations laid by the **Nandas**.
- first 3 rulers were Chandragupta (324/321-297 BCE), Bindusara (297-273BCE), and Ashoka.

### Origin Theory of Mauryas

- Some say Chandragupta was son of a low born from a woman called 'Mura' thus the name Maurya. This link with Nanda king is not followed by other classical sources.
- **Buddhist** say that he was member of Moriya clan of Pipphalivana linking them to the Sakyas.
- **Puranas** called Mauryas as Shudras, also say that Chanakya had put Chandragupta on the throne. Puranas looked down upon Magadhans because they were Heterodoxical.

### Sources and Details of Chandragupta Maurya Rule

- Buddhist texts such as the **Digha Nikaya, Mahavamsa, and Divyavadana** mentions them as Moriyas.
- Various other texts mentioning them : **Parishishtaparvan, Mudrarakshasa** and medieval **writings of Kshemendra and Somadeva.**

- Later **inscriptions of Jainas** such as those at Shravana Belagola have the word Chandra as their suffix
- Writings of foreign authors like **Plutarch and Justin** suggests Chandragupta to have over ran India and that he was the chief architect of the Mauryan Empire

> **D.D. Kosambi** argued that Alexanders Invasion "hastened the Mauryan conquest of the whole country."

- Alexanders invasion caused a vacuum in North West, governors there either assasinated or retreated making it easy for Chandragupta.
- Seleceus Nikator gave Chandragupta in lieu of 500 elephants eastern Afghanistan Baluchistan and the area west of the Indus.
	- Marriage alliance was also concluded.
	- He sent his ambassador Megasthenes.
	- Megasthenes was the ambassador of **Seleuceus Nikator** in the court of Chandragupta Maurya and wrote the book [[7.1 Sources from 200BC-300AD#Megasthenes' Indica |Indica]].

```ad-Views

Magadhan imperialism theory was put forward by Indian historians such as Radha Kumud Mookerji who started the concept and later expanded upon by D. D. Kosambi, and R. C. Majumdar.

Some scholars argue that the Mauryan Empire should not be considered an empire in the traditional sense, as it was not based on territorial conquest but rather on a system of alliances and treaties.
