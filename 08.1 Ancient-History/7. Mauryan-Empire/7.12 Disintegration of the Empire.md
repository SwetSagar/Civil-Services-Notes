  - Later rulers were Kunala, Dasharatha, Samprati, Salishuka, Devavarman, Satadhanvan and Brihadratha.

## Reasons for Disintegration

  1. Disorder emerged in adm due to **frequent successions of Kings** and **whether to follow the Dhamma of Ashoka** or dispense it with
  2. **Dhammamahamattas had grown powerful** and were interfering politically in the administration
  3. Kings that succeeded him were **not strong** enough to carry with the administration established as overwhelmingly new officials came in leading to a fragmentation of the central authority. This view was put forward by Dr R.K. Mookherjee.
	  - Romila Thapar has also supported this theory. Division of empire b/w Kunal and Dasrath contributed to the downfall
  4. **Frequent uprisings**, ==collapse of the complex system== of spies, military inactivity are some of the reasons for decline.
  5. V. A. Smith and Har Prasad Shastri say that usurpation by Pushyamitra was a ==strong Brahmanical reaction to the rise of Buddhism and Ashoka's policies.==
	  - They suggest that Dhammamahamattas were opressing the Brhamanas and destroying their prestige.
	  - If this was the case why did the reaction occur immediately after Ashoka,
	  - Ashokan's inscription say to respect all religions.
  6. Dr H.C. Raychaudhary saya that ==Ashoka's pacifist policies== made the military and himself weak.
		- Ashoka's policies on non-violence was not absolute.
		- He did not completely abandon death penalties,
		- killings of animals did not stop completely
		- it only reduced considerably.
		- If he was such a pacifist why did he not restore Kalinga to its ruler but instead annexed it.
1. Economic problems faced by Ashoka has been emphasized by **DD Kosambi**.
	  - He says that taxation was excessive and later phase punch marked coins have shown debasement
	  - Suggested that ==states monopoly on iron and other mines were compromised due to intervention by local chiefs== and due to the increase in expanding agrarian economy.
	  - Excessive deforestation would have caused more draughts, famines and natural disaster further draining the state treasury in repair and rehabilitation works

	 > **Romila Thapar has pointed that debasement of coins does not suggest crisis** it could have been done by merchants following the polititcal crisis that developed leading to hording of coins.

2. **Growth of Local Polities**
	- Frequent changing of kings meant that the ==loyalty of the local chiefs also changed== with it.
	- These chiefs were appointed from among the locals to govern them
	- were very powerful often ruling concurrently with the later Mauryas.
