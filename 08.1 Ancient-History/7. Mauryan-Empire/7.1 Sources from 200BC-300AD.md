The sources for the study of Mauryan dynasty are mainly derived from the archaeological and literary sources. The archaeological sources include the remains of the monuments, coins, inscriptions, seals and other objects unearthed from the sites associated with the Mauryan dynasty. The literary sources include the works of ancient writers like Megasthenes, Strabo, Arrian, Pliny, Diodorus, Justin, Kautilya, Patanjali, Buddhist and Jain texts.

The archaeological sources are considered to be the primary source of information about the Mauryan dynasty. Although these sources provide valuable information about the Mauryan period, they have certain limitations. Firstly, they provide limited information about the socio-cultural aspects of the Mauryan period. Secondly, they are limited in terms of geographical coverage, as most of the remains have been unearthed from the northern part of India. Thirdly, most of the archaeological sources are in fragments, which makes it difficult to interpret them correctly.

The literary sources are considered to be the secondary source of information about the Mauryan dynasty. These sources provide valuable insights into the socio-cultural aspects of the Mauryan period. However, these sources have certain limitations. Firstly, most of these sources are written by foreign authors who may not have an in-depth knowledge of the Mauryan period. Secondly, some of these sources contain exaggerated accounts and biased opinions about the Mauryan period. Thirdly, they are incomplete or fragmentary in nature, which makes it difficult to interpret them correctly.

The Mauryan period, which lasted from 321 BCE to 185 BCE, is one of the most significant periods in Indian history, and there are several sources available to study this period. However, the relative importance of each source varies, as each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are five sources of information for the study of the Mauryan period, along with five examples for each source:

1.  The Arthashastra by Kautilya: This is a treatise on statecraft and politics, and provides valuable insights into the administrative and economic systems of the Mauryan empire.
    
    -   Example 1: The Arthashastra details the responsibilities of various government officials, including the role of spies and informers.
    -   Example 2: It also outlines the tax collection and revenue management systems, including the classification of taxes into direct and indirect taxes.
2.  The Buddhist texts: Buddhism was a major religion during the Mauryan period, and several Buddhist texts, including the Jatakas and the Buddhist scriptures, provide valuable information on the social, cultural, and religious practices of the time.
    
    -   Example 1: The Jatakas provide accounts of the life of the Buddha and his previous lives, as well as stories that highlight the social norms and values of the time.
    -   Example 2: The Buddhist scriptures also provide information on the spread of Buddhism and its interaction with other religious and cultural traditions.
3.  Greek and Roman accounts: The Mauryan period saw significant interaction between the Indian subcontinent and the Hellenic world, and the accounts of Greek and Roman writers provide valuable insights into this relationship.
    
    -   Example 1: The Greek historian Megasthenes wrote an account of his travels in India, which provides valuable information on the geography, culture, and political systems of the Mauryan period.
    -   Example 2: The Roman writer Pliny the Elder also wrote about India, and his accounts provide information on trade and commerce between the two regions.
4.  Inscriptions and rock edicts: The Mauryan emperor Ashoka issued several rock edicts throughout the empire, which provide valuable information on his policies and principles, as well as on the administration of the empire.
    
    -   Example 1: The Rock Edict XIII, for instance, outlines Ashoka's policy of non-violence and religious tolerance.
    -   Example 2: The Minor Rock Edicts provide information on Ashoka's social and administrative policies, including the appointment of officers to maintain the welfare of the people.
5.  Archaeological evidence: Archaeological evidence provides information on the material culture and daily life during the Mauryan period, including details on architecture, trade, and industry.
    
    -   Example 1: Excavations at sites like Sarnath and Sanchi have revealed the ruins of Buddhist monasteries and stupas, which provide information on the spread of Buddhism and its material culture.
    -   Example 2: Excavations at sites like Taxila have also revealed the remains of urban centers and industrial workshops, providing information on trade and commerce during the Mauryan period.

1. Determine the veracity of Megasthenes' descriptions of Indian society and economy with the help of other contemporary evidences. [1994, 60m]
- [Critical Examination of Megasthenes Indica and other sources](onenote:[[Sources]]%20from%20200BC-%20300AD&section-id={C0CC9BD8-A1E3-4D8E-BE38-44EB6ABF19EE}&page-id={DD539256-5E7A-48AA-A70A-8F7C0ECB064C}&object-id={CC3DE098-61B5-4C8A-A74C-6927489C364E}&B&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/bbc8be5bd337910c/Documents/History%20Optional/Ancient%20History/Part%20II/Mauryan%20Empire.one)

Megasthenes was a Greek historian and ambassador who lived in the 4th century BCE and was sent by Seleucus I Nicator, the ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, to the court of the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya. His work, "Indika," provides valuable insights into Indian society and economy during the Mauryan period.

However, the veracity of Megasthenes' descriptions of Indian society and economy has been the subject of debate among historians. On the one hand, some of Megasthenes' descriptions are considered to be largely accurate and based on firsthand observation, while on the other hand, others have been criticized as being distorted or exaggerated.

One issue with Megasthenes' descriptions is that they are heavily influenced by Greek cultural and philosophical norms and biases, and may not accurately reflect the reality of Indian society and economy. For example, Megasthenes describes Indian society as being divided into seven classes, including philosophers, farmers, and soldiers, which may not accurately reflect the complex and hierarchical caste system of India at the time.

Moreover, Megasthenes' descriptions are often limited by the limited time he spent in India and the limited access he had to certain parts of the country and to certain social groups. As a result, his descriptions may not accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of Indian society and economy.

1.  Agricultural Economy: Megasthenes describes India as an agricultural economy, where agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for the majority of the population. This is supported by the descriptions of the land and water management systems in India as well as Ashoka's rock edicts, which mention the importance of agriculture and the development of irrigation systems.
    
2.  Trade and Commerce: Megasthenes describes the thriving trade and commerce in India, with a network of merchants, sea ports, and land-based trade routes. This is supported by the descriptions of the Mauryan administration and policies, which encouraged trade and commerce, as well as the evidence of a thriving trade network in the form of ancient trade routes, such as the Silk Road.
    
3.  Caste System: Megasthenes describes Indian society as being divided into seven classes, including philosophers, farmers, and soldiers. This is consistent with the descriptions of the caste system in ancient Indian texts, such as the Manusmriti, which outline the social and occupational divisions in ancient Indian society. However, the 7 fold division of society has not been supported by any contemporary sources.
    
4.  Urban Centers: Megasthenes describes the presence of large and well-planned cities in India, with a complex system of administration and governance. This is supported by the descriptions of the Mauryan administration and the existence of urban centers, such as Pataliputra, which was a thriving metropolis and the capital of the Mauryan empire given in the Arthashastra.
    
5.  Religious Practices: Megasthenes describes the presence of multiple religious beliefs and practices in India, including the worship of multiple gods and the practice of animal sacrifice. This is consistent with the descriptions of religious practices in ancient Indian texts, such as the Vedas, as well as the Buddhist texts, which describe the widespread presence of multiple religious beliefs and practices in ancient India.
