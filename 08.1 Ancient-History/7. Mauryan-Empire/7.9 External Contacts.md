The reign of Emperor Ashoka (268-232 BCE) marked a significant turning point in the history of ancient India, as he transformed the Mauryan Empire from a war-torn realm to a realm of peace, justice, and prosperity. In terms of domestic and foreign policies, the reign of Ashoka saw both elements of change and continuity.

Change in Domestic Policy:

1.  Abolition of War and Conquest: Ashoka renounced war and conquest, and instead sought to spread his message of peace and non-violence through his famous edicts.
    
2.  Promotion of Dhamma: Ashoka adopted the policy of Dhamma, which was a moral and ethical code that emphasized compassion, self-control, and generosity. He sought to propagate this code throughout his empire and beyond, through a network of rock edicts, pillars, and cave inscriptions.
    
3.  Establishment of a Bureaucratic System: Ashoka established a sophisticated system of administration, with a large bureaucracy to manage the affairs of his empire.
    

Continuity in Domestic Policy:

1.  Centralized Authority: Despite his adoption of the policy of Dhamma, Ashoka maintained a strong centralized authority over his empire, with a powerful army and administration to enforce his policies.
    
2.  Taxation System: The Mauryan taxation system, which was based on land and commerce, remained largely unchanged under Ashoka, as he continued to rely on this system to finance his administration and army.
    

Change in Foreign Policy:

1.  Expansion of Diplomacy: Ashoka pursued a policy of diplomacy, rather than war and conquest, and sent missions to various neighboring states to establish diplomatic relations and promote his message of peace and non-violence.
    
2.  Support for Buddhism: Ashoka became a patron of Buddhism and actively supported the spread of the religion beyond his borders.
    

Continuity in Foreign Policy:

1.  Maintaining Ties with the Hellenic World: Despite his adoption of Buddhism, Ashoka continued to maintain strong ties with the Hellenic world, which had a significant impact on his foreign policies and the spread of Buddhism.
    
2.  Tribute and Trade: Ashoka continued the Mauryan tradition of tribute and trade with neighboring states, which helped to maintain stability and peace in the region.

During the Mauryan period (321-185 BCE), India had significant contact with Western Asia and the Mediterranean world, which had a profound impact on the development of the Mauryan Empire and its culture. The nature of this contact was characterized by trade, diplomacy, and religious exchange.

1.  Trade: The Mauryan period saw the expansion of trade between India and Western Asia, as the Mauryan Empire established commercial relationships with the Hellenic kingdoms and other neighboring states. The primary items traded were spices, textiles, and precious stones, which were highly valued in the Mediterranean world.
    
2.  Diplomacy: The Mauryan emperors maintained diplomatic relations with various Western Asian states, including the Seleucid Empire, which helped to maintain peace and stability in the region.
    
3.  Religious Exchange: The Mauryan period saw a significant exchange of religious and philosophical ideas between India and Western Asia. Buddhism, which was introduced to India during this period, was greatly influenced by Hellenic thought and art. At the same time, the spread of Buddhism beyond India had a profound impact on the religious and philosophical development of Western Asia.
    

The impact of India's contact with Western Asia and the Mediterranean world during the Mauryan period was far-reaching and profound. It helped to shape the cultural, religious, and philosophical landscape of both India and Western Asia, and contributed to the development of a cosmopolitan and diverse cultural identity in the region.

In terms of the political and economic impact, the exchange of ideas and goods between India and Western Asia contributed to the development of the Mauryan Empire and its sophisticated system of administration and taxation. The expansion of trade and diplomacy helped to establish a stable and prosperous region, and contributed to the growth of cities and the development of urban culture.
