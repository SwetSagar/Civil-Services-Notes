## Characteristics

```ad-info

**V. Gordon Childe** identified ten factors that distinguished urbanization in his book "*What Happened in History"*. They are:

1.  A concentration of population in settlements.
2.  The emergence of a class of people who do not produce their own food.
3.  The development of a specialized labor force.
4.  The appearance of a full-time administration and political class.
5.  The emergence of a system of record-keeping.
6.  The appearance of monumental public architecture.
7.  The development of long-distance trade.
8.  The emergence of a money economy.
9.  The development of a distinct religious ideology.
10.  The emergence of a writing system.

```

### General Characterstics

- Use of Burnt bricks on a large scale, not found in Egypt and Mesopotamia
- No hoe or ploughshare, furrows used for ploughing except Kalibangan.
- Channel or Canal irrigation

```ad-Views

“Harappans appear to have invested less effort to control water resources by largescale canal irrigation near cities but relied primarily on fluvial inundation for winter crops and additionally on rain for summer crops,” : Liviu Giosan [^2]

```

  ![[3.1 Origin, Date and Extent#Date|Characterstics]]

    - Artefacts are distributed equally at sites
    - Precious/ semi percious metals stones discovered in small villages

## Decline

- Cities like Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Kalibangan experienced gradual decline in urban planning and construction. Houses were being made of old bricks, construction of them encroached streets and were haphazard in shape. Cities were turning into slums.
- Entry points to Mohenjodaro's Great bath was blocked and later it and the granary fell into disuse.
- Distinct reduction in the-number of sculptures, figurines, beads, bangles and inlay works was seen.
- Harappa was marked by the arrival of a new group of people marked by their burial practice called the Cemetery H culture.
- The population and the settlements around the core area of Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Bahawalpur decreased but those around areas of Gujarat, East Punjab, Haryana and upper Doab increased. This could have been due to emigration of people from the core region.
- writing, uniform weights, Harappan pottery and architectural style had disappeared.
- Mesopotamian literature stops referring to Meluhha by the end of 1900 B.C.

### Theories of Sudden Decline

#### Floods and Earthquakes

- In Mohenjodaro various periods of occupation were separated by **evidences of deep flooding** and **clayey silt** as high as 80 feet.
- R. Sutlej could have changed its course or due to the sudden rise in Arabian sea coastline

##### R.L. Raikes Catastrophic Flooding

- prolonged submergence of cities around Indus
- earthquakes/tectonic movts raised level of flood plains in lower Indus level Leading to the formation of lake swallowed Mohenjodaro
- coastal town hampered due tectonic movements

##### H.T. Lambrick

- river would be dammed in such a manner by tectonic uplifts is incorrect because
- large water of Indus could have easily breached the bund created by an earthquake.
- deposition of silt might not have been the result of flooding.
- fails to explain decline outside the Indus valley

#### Barbarian Invasions

- Ramparasad Chanda 1926 and Mortimer Wheeler 1947 were proponents
- Wheeler believed that the Harappan civilization was destroyed by the Aryan invaders.
- Late Phases at Mohenjodaro has evidences of Massacre. Rig Veda mentions the destruction of fortresses of Dasas and Dasyus and Indra has been called as Purandhara or the destroyer of forts.
- the Rig Veda mentions a place called Hariyupiya identified as Harappa on the banks of river Ravi.
- Aryans on the other hand are believed to have arrived here not earlier than a period around 1500 B.C whereas Harappa decline in 1800 BC.
    - massacre could have been caused by bandits from hilly regions.

### Theories of Gradual Decline

- **Mohenjodaro** and **Dholavira** give a picture of gradual decline while at Kalibangan and Banawali life ended all of a sudden
- overlap b/w late Harappan and PGW culture at sites like **Bhagwanpura** and **Dadheri** in Haryana and Katpalon and Nagar in Punjab.
- overlap b/w Harappan and OCP levels in **Bargaon** and **Ambakheri** in Western UP.

#### Shifting away of the Indus

- A/C to Lambrick the change of course was the reason for decline.
- Shift led to dec in food production and water, silt was result of wind deposition and from the decaying of bricks
- does not explain the decline of other settlements
- People of Mohenjodaro could have easily moved towards the changed course of the river.

#### Increased Aridity and Drying Up of the Ghaggar

```ad-Views
 
It was put forward by D.P. Agarwal and Sood.

```

- dec in moisture water availability. In semi-arid regions of Harappa this could create a major disaster.
- tectonic disturbance - to change in course of Ghaggar's tributaries Sutlej and Yamuna
- difficult to date drying of river, more info required

#### Ecological Imbalance

```ad-Views

- **Fairservis** is a proponent of this. A/C to him the delicate ecological balance of these semi-arid areas disturbed due to human cattle popu in these areas was fast depleting the scanty forests, food and fuel resources

```

- caused increase in floods and droughts in an already semi-arid precarious area and completed by raids from surrounding areas
- fertility of soil in the subsequent periods did not decrease
- More information would be required to calculate subsistence of H

```ad-Views

According to Malik's analysis, there was a major shift in monsoon patterns just before the dawn of this civilisation and that the pattern reversed course right before it declined, indicating it was in fact climate change that caused the fall. [^1]

```

### Man Made Reasons for Decling

- What man made reasons could have been the cause of decline of H. civ?
    - Over **cultivation**
    - Over **grazing**
    - Deforestation for fuel and farming

## Survival

```ad-Views

**Malik and Possehl** focused their attention on various aspects of continuity of the Harappan tradition

```

- Jhukar pottery in use in Amri, Chanhudaro, Jhukar etc have shown similarity to the Mature Harappan pottery.
- Metal objects here have shown contact with central asian and Iranian influences vzi axes, copper pins, shaft hole etc and circular stamp seals.
- Indo Iranian borderlands show the use of copper stand seals and copper shaft hole axes in sites like Mundigak, Nausharo and Pirak indicating contact with Iran
- In Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana sites like Mitathal, Bara, Ropar and Siswal have shown Ochre coloured pottery.
- In Kutch and Saurashtra places like Rangapur and Somnath have shown continuity in ceramic traditions.
- These harappan settlements would have merged with the regional and local settlements of the area and slowly the regional cultures of pottery etc replaced the Harappan ones.
- The cults of Pasupati (Siva) and of the mother goddess and phallic worship seem to have come down to us from the Harappan tradition.
- the cult of sacred places, rivers or trees and sacred animals show a distinct continuity in the subsequent historic civilization of India. The evidence of fire worship and sacrifice in Kalihgan and Lothal is significant
- traditional weight and currency system of India, based on a ratio of sixteen as the unit, was already present in the Harapp civilization
- techniques Bf making potter's wheel in modern India is similar to those used by the Harappans
- Bullock carts and boats used in modem India were already present in the Harappan cities

## Significance

- [x] #todo
- Its significance would be unique features of Society, Polity, Economy and Art and Culture and their continuity seen today in the Modern world.

```ad-Answer

The town planning of the Indus cities is considered to be one of the most advanced and sophisticated urban planning systems of the ancient world. The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was one of the earliest known civilizations, flourishing in the region of the Indus River in what is now Pakistan and northwestern India from around 3300 to 1300 BCE. The cities of the IVC were well-planned and organized, featuring large-scale public architecture and elaborate drainage systems.

The cities of the IVC were laid out in a grid pattern, with streets running in north-south and east-west directions. The streets were wide and straight, with the main streets being up to 25 meters wide. The streets were also lined with brick-lined drainage systems, which were designed to efficiently remove waste and rainwater from the city. The city walls were also designed to keep out floods and other natural disasters.

The city of Harappa is a good example of the advanced town planning of the IVC. The city was laid out in a grid pattern, with the main streets running in north-south and east-west directions. The city was divided into two parts, with the citadel in the center and the lower town surrounding it. The citadel was surrounded by a massive wall, which was up to 12 meters thick and 10 meters high. The city also had an elaborate drainage system, which included a large number of brick-lined drains.

The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization is thought to have been caused by a number of factors, including natural disasters, climate change, and the migration of other peoples into the region. 

The decline of the IVC is also thought to have been caused by a shift in the course of the Indus River. According to historian Lambert, “The movement of the Indus River from its original course to the south is thought to have caused the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization.” This shift in the river’s course is thought to have caused the cities of the IVC to become increasingly vulnerable to flooding, which is thought to have led to their eventual abandonment.

In conclusion, the town planning of the Indus cities was highly advanced and sophisticated, and was likely one of the most advanced urban planning systems of the ancient world. However, the decline of the IVC is thought to have been caused by a combination of natural disasters, climate change, and the migration of other peoples into the region, as well as a shift in the course of the Indus River.

The Indus Civilization was one of the earliest and most expansive civilizations in the world, occupying a large area in the Indian subcontinent that stretched from present-day Afghanistan to Pakistan and western India. It flourished from approximately 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE and was characterized by a highly organized urban culture that was based on sophisticated agricultural and trading practices.

The Indus Civilization was a highly advanced and complex culture that relied heavily on trade and cultural contacts with other civilizations. This is evidenced by the presence of artifacts from other cultures, such as Mesopotamian seals and pottery, in the Indus cities. The Indus cities also had extensive trade networks with other contemporary civilizations, such as the Sumerians, Harappans, and the Egyptians. This trade included the exchange of goods such as copper, tin, gold, silver, and ivory, as well as the exchange of ideas and technologies.

One of the most important Indus sites within India is the city of Mohenjo-Daro. Located in the modern-day province of Sindh in Pakistan, Mohenjo-Daro was one of the largest cities of the Indus Civilization. It was a major urban center, featuring a sophisticated urban planning system, advanced drainage systems, and a complex irrigation system. The city was also home to a number of religious and cultural sites, such as the Great Bath and the Great Granary. Additionally, the city was home to a number of craft workshops, where artisans produced beads, pottery, and other artifacts.

The decline of the major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization is an issue that has puzzled historians for centuries. According to the renowned British archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler, “It is impossible to give a definite answer to the question of why the Indus Valley Civilization declined.” Many theories have been put forward to explain the decline, but no single one has been conclusively proven. 

One popular theory is that the Indus Valley Civilization was destroyed by a great flood, which many historians such as RL Raikes and HT Lambrick believe was caused by the bursting of a natural dam in the region. This theory is supported by archaeological evidence of a large-scale flood in the region, as well as the presence of flood-related artifacts such as fishhooks and mud bricks. 

Other theories focus on the impact of climate change on the civilization. According to the American archaeologist Fairservis, “The Indus Valley Civilization was located in a region that experienced significant climate change around 2000 BCE. This climate change may have had a direct impact on the civilization, leading to its decline.” 

The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization may also have been caused by the arrival of new peoples in the region. According to the British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler, “The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization may have been caused by the arrival of new peoples in the region, who brought with them new technologies and customs.” 

Finally, some historians believe that the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization was caused by internal factors, such as political instability or economic decline. According to the British archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler, “The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization may have been caused by internal factors, such as political instability or economic decline.” 

In conclusion, the decline of the major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization is an issue that has puzzled historians for centuries. While many theories have been put forward to explain the decline, no single one has been conclusively proven. The most likely explanations are that the decline was caused by a great flood, climate change, the arrival of new peoples in the region, or internal factors such as political instability or economic decline.

```ad-Answer

The phrase "On circumstantial evidence Indra stands convicted" is a reference to the theory that the god Indra, a major deity in Hinduism, was responsible for the sudden collapse of the Indus Valley civilization. This theory is based on the fact that the Rigveda, one of the oldest texts of Hinduism, contains hymns that describe a battle between the god Indra and the people of the Indus Valley, in which he is said to have destroyed their cities and fortifications.

However, this theory is considered by many scholars to be unlikely, as there is little concrete evidence to support it. Instead, most experts believe that the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization was the result of a combination of factors, including environmental changes, such as changes in the course of the Indus River, as well as internal social and economic factors.

In relation to the presence of elements in Indian culture and civilization which are found to have existed in the Indus Valley period, some scholars suggests that these elements were likely inherited from the Indus Valley civilization through cultural continuity, which is the gradual and peaceful transition of cultural traits from one society to another. This can happen through trade and other forms of interaction, such as migration and intermarriage.

Others suggest that the Indus Valley civilization was conquered and absorbed by the Aryans. This is known as the Aryan Invasion Theory, which suggests that the Aryans, a group of nomadic people from Central Asia, invaded and conquered the Indus Valley civilization, and adopted many of

its cultural elements into their own culture and civilization. The Aryan Invasion Theory, however, is now considered to be outdated by most scholars and there is no concrete evidence to support it. The theory of migration and cultural exchange through peaceful means is more widely accepted.

Another theory proposed by some scholars is that the Indus Valley civilization declined gradually, due to a combination of factors such as climate change, overuse of resources, and internal conflicts. According to this theory, the civilization gradually declined and eventually collapsed, with some of its people moving to other regions and taking their culture and civilization with them. This theory of decline and migration is supported by the fact that many elements of Indus Valley culture and civilization, such as writing systems, seals, and religious practices, have been found in later cultures and civilizations in India, such as the Vedic civilization, which is considered to be a successor of the Indus Valley civilization.

The Indus Civilization was one of the most advanced and complex ancient civilizations that existed in the Indian subcontinent. It was a Bronze Age civilization that flourished in the Indus Valley from around 3300 BCE to 1700 BCE. The Indus Civilization is often referred to as the Harappan Civilization, after the ancient city of Harappa, which was one of the major cities of the civilization. The Indus Civilization had an abrupt end, which is still debated among scholars.

The cause of the abrupt end of the Indus Civilization is still unknown. There are many theories that have been proposed, including environmental changes, the invasion of the Aryans, and natural disasters. However, none of these theories have been proven conclusively. This has led to much speculation about the cause of the end of the Indus Civilization.

Despite its abrupt end, the Indus Civilization had a lasting influence on Indian culture and society. The Indus Valley was home to a number of important cities, including Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro, and Lothal. These cities were highly developed, with sophisticated systems of drainage, irrigation, and fortification. They were also home to a number of advanced art forms, such as pottery and sculpture.

The Indus Civilization also had a significant influence on Indian religion. The Indus Valley was home to a number of religious cults, such as the worship of the mother goddess and the cult of the sacred bull. These cults survived the end of the Indus Civilization and continued to influence Indian religion and culture in later history.

The Indus Civilization also had a significant influence on the development of Indian language. The Indus Valley was home to a number of languages, including the Dravidian languages and the Indo-Aryan languages. These languages were the basis for the development of the modern languages of India, such as Brahui etc.

The Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley flourished along the Indus River and its tributaries in the modern-day countries of India and Pakistan. The civilization was an advanced urban culture that flourished from around 3300 to 1300 BCE and is known for its impressive cities and monuments, as well as its sophisticated engineering and art.

One of the most impressive aspects of the Harappan civilization is its extensive external trade network. The Harappans were a trading people, engaging in a wide variety of trade activities with their neighbors and distant lands. This trade network extended from the Gulf of Oman in the west to the Ganges Valley in the east and from Central Asia in the north to the Indian Ocean in the south.

The Harappans traded a variety of goods, including cotton, spices, ivory, lapis lazuli, and other precious stones. They also traded in metals such as copper, tin, lead, and bronze. The Harappan cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa were important centers of trade, and their ports were used to facilitate the movement of goods.

The Harappans also engaged in long-distance trade with distant lands such as Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. They traded in a variety of goods, including lapis lazuli, gold, silver, and a variety of other precious stones and metals. The Harappans also traded in various kinds of food, such as dates and wheat.

The Harappans also had a well-developed system of weights and measures, which allowed them to accurately assess the value of goods for trade. This system of weights and measures was used throughout the Harappan civilization and was also used in other parts of the world, including Mesopotamia.

The Indus Civilization, which existed from around 3200 BCE to 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and northwest India, had a complex system of burial customs. The civilization is known for its well-planned cities, advanced drainage systems, and sophisticated seals and sculptures, but little is known about its religious beliefs and funerary practices. However, excavations of Indus sites have uncovered some information about the civilization's burial customs.

One of the most striking features of Indus burials is the use of funerary goods. Excavations at the site of Harappa have revealed burials containing a variety of objects, such as pottery, beads, and bronze tools. These items may have been placed in the graves to accompany the deceased in the afterlife or to serve as offerings to the gods. The presence of such goods suggests that the Indus people had a belief in an afterlife and placed importance on providing for the deceased.

Another notable aspect of Indus burials is the presence of a distinct form of burial: the extended inhumation. This type of burial involves placing the body in a flexed or curled position on its side, with the knees drawn up to the chest. This type of burial is unique to the Indus Civilization and has been found in several sites, including Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. The extended inhumation suggests that the Indus people may have had specific beliefs about the posture of the deceased in the afterlife.

The Indus Civilization was an ancient civilization that existed in the Indus Valley from 3300 BCE to 1800 BCE. This civilization was one of the earliest known urban societies and was home to a number of advanced cultural developments. One of the most important aspects of the Indus Civilization was its religion, which is still largely a mystery.

The religion of the Indus Civilization is believed to have been polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods and goddesses. The most important gods were the fertility goddess, and the mother goddess. These gods were believed to rule over all aspects of life.

The Indus Civilization also had a number of rituals and festivals that were associated with their religion. These festivals were often associated with the changing of the seasons and with the sowing and harvesting of crops. The presence of Great Bath and Granary in Mohenjodaro could be for this purpose.

The religion of the Indus Civilization also included the worship of animals. The bull, elephant, and tiger were all important animals in the religion, and the people of the Indus Civilization believed that these animals had spiritual power. They also believed that these animals could be used to communicate with the gods and goddesses.

The religion of the Indus Civilization also included the worship of fire. Fire was believed to have magical powers and was used in many rituals. The presence of fire altars in Kalibangan. Kalibangan has also given phallic emblems which could denote a proto-Shiva pantheon in the region.

Salient features of Indus Valley Civilization.

1.  Advanced urban planning and architecture: The Indus Valley civilization is known for its well-planned cities, which were situated along major trade routes and served as important centers of trade and commerce. The cities had a grid-like pattern of streets, and many of the buildings were constructed of brick and stone. The most notable examples of Indus architecture are the Great Bath and the Granary at Mohenjo-daro, which are considered to be some of the most advanced structures of their time.
    
2.  Sophisticated system of trade and commerce: The Indus civilization had a well-developed system of trade networks that stretched across the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The discovery of standardized weights and measures, as well as seals and seals impressions, indicates a highly organized system of trade and commerce. The Indus people traded mainly in raw materials such as precious metals, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and precious stones, and also traded in luxury goods such as carnelian beads and ivory.
    
3.  Advanced technology: The Indus civilization was known for its advanced technology, which included the use of bronze, copper, and other metals. The civilization also had a well-developed system of irrigation, which allowed them to cultivate crops in the dry and arid regions of the Indus Valley. They also had a well-developed system of drainage, which helped to prevent flooding in their cities.
    
4.  Complex system of writing: The Indus civilization is known for its complex system of writing, which has not yet been deciphered. The writing system is found on seals, pottery, and other artifacts, and is considered to be one of the most advanced writing systems of its time.
    
5.  Religious and spiritual beliefs: The Indus civilization is known for its religious and spiritual beliefs, which included the use of seals and other symbols that may have been associated with religious and spiritual beliefs. The civilization had a complex system of religious and spiritual beliefs and practices, which is not well understood due to the lack of written records.
    
6.  Social and economic stratification: The Indus civilization is known for its social and economic stratification, with evidence of a ruling class, a middle class, and a lower class. The discovery of large storage facilities and other evidence of craft production in the cities suggests that the cities played an important role in the distribution and exchange of goods within the civilization. The presence of large public structures and other evidence of public works suggests that the civilization had a well-developed system of government and public administration.

Urbanization, the process of people moving from rural areas to live in cities, is a gradual and complex process that has been shaped by various factors such as economic, political, social and technological developments. The development of urbanization can be traced back to the third millennium BCE, with the emergence of early urban centers such as those of the Indus Valley civilization in the Indian subcontinent and the Sumerian cities in Mesopotamia.

During the third millennium BCE, urbanization began with the emergence of the first urban centers, such as the cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in the Indus Valley civilization. These early cities were characterized by advanced urban planning, sophisticated systems of drainage and irrigation, and impressive public buildings. They also had a well-developed system of trade and commerce and a complex system of writing.

In the second millennium BCE, urbanization continued to develop with the emergence of new urban centers in Mesopotamia and Egypt, such as Ur, Uruk, and Memphis. These cities were characterized by monumental architecture, complex systems of writing, and advanced systems of trade and commerce.

In the first millennium BCE, urbanization continued to develop with the emergence of new urban centers in the Middle East, such as the Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon, and the Greek city-states of Athens and Corinth. These cities were characterized by monumental architecture, advanced systems of trade and commerce, and the development of new technologies such as coinage.

During the 6th century BCE, urbanization continued to develop in the Indian subcontinent with the emergence of new urban centers such as Rajgriha and Pataliputra, the capital of Magadha and later the Mauryan Empire, and Taxila, an important center of trade and commerce. These cities were characterized by advanced urban planning, impressive public buildings, and sophisticated systems of trade and commerce.

1. Evaluate the significance of seals and sealings in the reconstruction of socio-economic and religious life of the Harappan people. [2012, 30m]

```ad-Answer

Seals and sealings are an integral part of the archaeological record of the Harappan civilization. They provide a wealth of information about the socio-economic and religious life of the Harappan people. Seals were used for a variety of purposes, including sealing documents, containers, and goods. The most common type of seal was a small, square terracotta tablet with a picture or inscription on one side and an impression of the seal on the other. This impression was made by pressing the seal into clay, wax, or other soft material.

The seals and sealings of the Harappan civilization provide invaluable insight into the social and economic life of the people. The images on the seals depict a variety of scenes, including animals, plants, people, and gods. These images are thought to represent the religious beliefs and practices of the Harappan people. For example, the Pashupati seal, one of the most famous Harappan seals, shows a figure seated in a yogic posture surrounded by four animals. This figure is believed to represent a deity and has been associated with the Hindu god Shiva.

The seals and sealings also provide evidence of the trade networks of the Harappan civilization. The seals have been found in sites throughout the region, suggesting that the Harappans were engaged in extensive trade with other cultures. The seals also provide evidence of the use of a standardized system of weights and measures. This system was used to regulate trade and to ensure the accurate exchange of goods.

The seals and sealings of the Harappan civilization also provide evidence of the political and administrative structure of the society. The seals depict a variety of symbols and inscriptions, which are thought to represent the titles of various officials and rulers. The seals also provide evidence of the use of writing by the Harappans. The inscriptions on the seals are believed to be in a form of proto-Dravidian, an early form of the Dravidian language family.

The Indus-Saraswati Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, is known for its advanced water management and conservation planning. The civilization existed from around 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE in present-day Pakistan and northwest India and is considered to be one of the most ancient and advanced civilization in the world. The civilization's cities were well-planned and had sophisticated water management systems that ensured a steady supply of water for the inhabitants.

One example of the civilization's water management can be seen at the site of Mohenjo-daro. Excavations at the site have revealed a complex system of drainage that included underground and surface channels, manholes, and sump wells. This system not only ensured proper drainage but also helped to collect and store water for future use. The city also had a sophisticated system of wells and water storage tanks, which provided a reliable source of water for the inhabitants.

Another example of the civilization's water management can be seen at the site of Harappa. Excavations at the site have revealed a large, man-made reservoir that was used to store water. The reservoir, known as the Great Bath, was lined with bricks and plaster and had a sophisticated system of channels and drains to ensure a steady supply of water. The Great Bath also had steps leading down to the water's edge, indicating that it may have been used for religious or ceremonial purposes.

The Harappan Civilization also had a sophisticated system of water conservation planning. The cities were built on the banks of the Indus and Saraswati rivers, and the civilization's engineers were able to harness the power of these rivers to irrigate their crops. They also made use of canals, dams, and artificial ponds to conserve water.

Cities such as Lothal has given a large dockyard. Some scholars suggest it to be used for water storage purposes. Dholavira in Kutch has multiple wells that are still in used today. Wells in places such as Allahdino had narrow diameters for the water to rise up the top.

This system of water management was not new and was practiced in pre Harappan cities of the area such as Nal which has given elaborate water management system at the Neolithic level.

The Harappan civilization had a diverse subsistence base. The Harappan civilization, also known as the Indus Valley civilization, was a Bronze Age civilization located in the Indus Valley in the Indian subcontinent. It was one of the earliest urban civilizations in South Asia, flourishing between the 33rd and 18th centuries BCE. The Harappan civilization is believed to have had a population of over five million people and was one of the most advanced civilizations of its time.

The Harappan civilization had a diverse subsistence base, relying on a variety of agricultural, pastoral, and marine sources for their sustenance. Agriculture was the primary subsistence base for the Harappans. They cultivated wheat, barley, sesame, peas, and other crops in the floodplains of the Indus and its tributaries. The Harappans also raised livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. They also had a sophisticated system of irrigation, which allowed them to maximize their agricultural production.

In addition to agriculture, the Harappans also relied on pastoralism for their subsistence. They kept herds of sheep and goats, which provided them with meat, milk, and wool. They also kept camels and horses, which were used for transportation. 

The Harappans also relied on marine resources for their subsistence. They had access to the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Kutch, which provided them with a variety of fish and shellfish. The Harappans also collected pearls, which were used for adornment and trade. 

The Harappans also had a sophisticated system of trade and commerce. They traded with other civilizations in the region, such as the Mesopotamians, and also had access to a variety of goods from distant lands. These goods included copper, tin, lapis lazuli, and other precious materials. 

The Harappans also had access to a variety of craftspeople, such as potters, weavers, and carpenters, who produced a variety of goods for the Harappans’ consumption. The Harappans also had access to a variety of tools and weapons, which enabled them to hunt and defend themselves.

This diversity of subsistence base enabled the Harappans to become one of the most advanced civilizations of its time.

One of the main advantages of these areas is their proximity to the Indus River and its tributaries, which provided a reliable source of water for irrigation and the growth of crops. The Indus Valley civilization was known for its advanced system of irrigation, which allowed them to cultivate crops in the dry and arid regions of the Indus Valley.

Another advantage of these areas is that they were relatively well-suited for the domestication of certain animals, such as the water buffalo, which were important for agriculture and transportation. The presence of these animals helped to support the growth of the civilization.

In addition, the semi-arid areas with saline groundwater were also relatively less suitable for the cultivation of certain crops, such as rice and wheat, which were the mainstay of other civilizations in the region. The Harappans instead developed different agricultural systems that were well-suited to their environment, such as the cultivation of barley, wheat, and a variety of other crops, which allowed them to sustain their civilization.

Furthermore, these areas were also near the coast, which facilitated maritime trade and communication with other cultures and civilizations, such as those of Mesopotamia, Central Asia, and the Persian Gulf. The Indus civilization's trade networks and well-developed system of economic organization played a significant role in the growth and development of the cities and towns.

1. Critically examine various views regarding the Vedic-Harappan relationship in light of the latest discoveries. [2017, 15 Marks]

```ad-Answer

The relationship between the Indus Valley Civilization (also known as the Harappan Civilization) and the Vedic culture has been a topic of debate among scholars for many years. The Vedic culture is associated with the Vedic texts, such as the Rigveda, which are considered to be the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism and are dated to around 1500 BCE. The Indus Valley Civilization, on the other hand, existed from around 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE.

One view is that the Vedic culture is the successor of the Indus Valley Civilization and that the people of the Indus Valley Civilization were the ancestors of the Vedic people. This view is based on the similarities between the two cultures, such as the presence of the fire altar in both cultures, the worship of mother goddesses, and the use of the swastika symbol.

Another view is that the two cultures were contemporaneous but had little or no direct influence on each other. This view is based on the fact that there is no direct evidence of a link between the two cultures, such as inscriptions or artifacts that show a connection. Furthermore, the two cultures had different scripts, different systems of weights and measures, and different religious practices.

A third view is that the Vedic culture migrated into the Indus Valley and influenced the people of the Indus Valley Civilization. This view is based on the fact that the Rigveda mentions the region of the Indus Valley and that the Vedic people were a pastoral people who may have migrated into the Indus Valley in search of new grazing land.

The latest discoveries in archaeology, epigraphy and other fields have provided new insights into the relationship between the Indus Valley Civilization and the Vedic culture. The discovery of the pre-Vedic culture in the Indus Valley region which is contemporary to Indus Valley Civilization and the discovery of the Proto-Siva seal from the Indus Valley Civilization have provided evidence to support the continuity of culture and religion from the Indus Valley Civilization to the Vedic culture. Moreover, the study of the linguistic and genetic affinities of the Indus Valley Civilization people, suggest that the Indus Valley Civilization people were the ancestors of the Vedic people and the people who continued to live in the region after the Indus Civilization collapse.

The Harappan civilization was one of the most advanced and sophisticated civilizations of the ancient world. It flourished in the Indus Valley region of India and Pakistan from approximately 3300 BCE to 1700 BCE. Archaeological evidence provides insight into the decline of this great civilization, but does not give direct access to the possible social and political dimensions of its decline.

Archaeological evidence shows that the decline of the Harappan civilization was a gradual process. It began with the decline of the great cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, which were once the centers of the civilization. These cities were abandoned and their populations dispersed, indicating a decline in the power and influence of the civilization. The decline of the cities was followed by a decline in the production and trade of the civilization’s major commodities, such as copper, bronze, and pottery.

The decline of the Harappan civilization is also evidenced by a decline in the quality of craftsmanship and artistry. The pottery and other artifacts that have been found in the archaeological sites of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro show a decline in the quality of craftsmanship and artistry. This decline in craftsmanship and artistry is indicative of a decline in the civilization’s economic and social structure, as the craftspeople and artisans were no longer able to produce the same level of quality goods.

The decline of the Harappan civilization is also evidenced by a decline in the use of writing. The civilization was known for its use of a script, but the script is no longer in use and there is no evidence of it being used after the decline of the civilization. This indicates that the civilization had lost its ability to communicate and record its thoughts and ideas.

Finally, the decline of the Harappan civilization is also evidenced by the presence of new cultures in the region. Archaeological evidence shows that the region was inhabited by new cultures, such as the Aryans, after the decline of the Harappan civilization. This indicates that the decline of the Harappan civilization was accompanied by a shift in the political and social landscape of the region.

The archaeological evidence of the decline of the Harappan civilization does not give direct access to the possible social and political dimensions of its decline. However, it does provide insight into the gradual process of de-urbanization and decline in the quality of craftsmanship and artistry that the civilization experienced. 

It also provides evidence of the presence of new cultures in the region after the decline of the Harappan civilization, indicating a shift in the political and social landscape of the region. The archaeological evidence of the decline of the Harappan civilization is therefore useful in understanding the decline of this great civilization, but it does not provide direct access to the possible social and political dimensions of its decline.
