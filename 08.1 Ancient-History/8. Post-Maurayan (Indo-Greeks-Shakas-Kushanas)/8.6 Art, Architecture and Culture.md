1. Explain as to how the early Buddhist Stupa art, while using folk motifs and narratives and common cultural symbols, succeeded in transforming these themes for expounding the Buddhist ideals. [2013, 20m]

```ad-Answer

The early Buddhist stupa art, which was created during the time of the Buddha's teachings in India and during the following centuries, transformed traditional folk motifs, narratives, and cultural symbols by imbuing them with Buddhist meaning. This allowed the artists to communicate Buddhist ideals to a wide audience using symbols and motifs that were already familiar to them.

For example, the use of Hindu gods and goddesses in Buddhist art was transformed by depicting them as supporters of the Buddha and his teachings, rather than as the objects of worship in their own right. This conveyed the message that even the traditional gods recognized the superiority of the Buddha's teachings.

Similarly, traditional folk tales and narratives were transformed by highlighting the Buddhist moral lessons they embodied. For instance, the story of the bodhisattva prince who renounced his royal status to become a monk was interpreted as a symbol of the importance of seeking spiritual knowledge and wisdom over material wealth and power.

The use of common cultural symbols, such as the lotus flower, was also transformed in Buddhist art. In traditional Hindu art, the lotus was a symbol of creation, but in Buddhist art, it came to symbolize the pure and perfect nature of the Buddha and the path to enlightenment.

In this way, early Buddhist stupa art was able to transform common cultural symbols, folk tales, and narratives into powerful tools for expounding Buddhist ideals. This allowed the Buddha's teachings to be communicated to a wide audience in a way that was both accessible and meaningful to them, and helped to ensure the spread and preservation of the Buddha's teachings for future generations.

1. Explain as to how the early Buddhist Stupa art, while using folk motifs and narratives and common cultural symbols, succeeded in transforming these themes for expounding the Buddhist ideals. [2013, 20m]

```ad-Answer

The early Buddhist Stupa art was highly successful in transforming common cultural symbols and folk motifs and narratives into representations of Buddhist ideals. These monuments were often large sculptures, constructed at important Buddhist pilgrimage sites, and designed to honor Buddhist teachings and the deeds of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

The Buddha figure at the center of the stupa served as a powerful visual metaphor for the teachings on enlightenment and nirvana. The stupa’s four sides symbolized the four directions one must travel to attain enlightenment, while the shape of the stupa itself was meant to resemble the mountains symbolizing the elevation of enlightenment. Other familiar motifs like sun and stars, trees, flowers, animals, and even chariots surrounded the main Buddha figure in a mix of narrative and abstract expressions.

The way that these symbols were employed and reconfigured in the stupas expressed multiple layered meanings and it allowed the early Buddhist artists to use familiar symbols to illustrate complex Buddhist concepts. By combining these symbolic and figurative elements, the early Buddhist stupas created powerful visual messages that utilized and transformed traditional themes to reach a wide audience and effectively expound the Buddhist ideals.

The Kushana period was one of the most prosperous ancient Indian cultures, known for its artistic and architectural achievements. The main art forms of this period include stone sculpture, metal sculpture, murals, wall paintings, textiles, jewellery, and coins. The main themes depicted in the Kushana art describe the life of the royal court, the gods and goddesses, and the scenes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.

In the early medieval period, the art forms took a more religious turn with the emergence of Hinduism and Buddhism. This is seen in the rise of temple architecture like the magnificent temples at Ellora and Ajanta. The artwork during this period depicted themes from the religious texts, but with a more stylized approach. For example, sculpture became more ornate with intricate carvings and a focus on detail. Paintings used bright colors, vibrant figures, and religious themes like the images of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.

Overall, the changes in art from the Kushana period to the early medieval period can be seen as a reflection of the changing outlook of people. As religion and spirituality took center stage, the artwork shifted from depicting scenes from court life to religious figures and texts. This reflects the changing beliefs and values that were being espoused in the early medieval period.

Gandhara art is a type of Greco-Buddhist art that was created in the region of Gandhara during the 1st to the 7th centuries CE. This region covered much of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan, and was heavily influenced by the cultures of its Hellenistic, Indian and Persian neighbors. It is seen by some as the fusion of Western and Eastern art, and is a key influence in Buddhist art.

The origins of the art form date back to the Greek conquests of Alexander the Great and its subsequent Seleucid dynasty. As with much of the Art of the period, Gandhara artists blended classical Greek traditional motifs with local Hindu images, to create a style of art that was influenced by both cultures. It is likely that the art of the region is an example of cultural exchange as opposed to a singular artistic movement. It was during the Kushan period in the 2nd century CE, that the art form saw a truly large scale expansion.

The main characteristics of Gandhara art revolve around the use of human figures in narrative settings. figural representations of the Buddha were often given certain stylistic techniques associated with Greco-Roman art, such as drapery, hair parted in the middle, and almond shaped eyes. This style of artistic expression was not just reserved for the Buddha, but popularly was associated with representations of Bodhisattvas, saints and the Hindu gods. These figures were often depicted in scenes from Buddhist texts and stories, allowing for dynamic narrative pieces. Along with sculpture, these artists used literary and wall paintings as a medium for their works.

Considering the geographically expansive region that the art of Gandhara was created in, it was heavily spread out. This included much of modern day Pakistan and Afghanistan and was also found in Modern day Kashmir, China, Tibet, and India. After the 7th century, the art form was largely replaced by the Kashmiri style of art, while the Greco-Buddhist styles still influenced the art of the region. 

Gandhara art is a crucial part of Indian and Greco-Roman histories and is important for understanding further the art and culture of the region. It is still studied and appreciated today and is a testament to the creative genius of these ancient cultures.

The post-Mauryan period (c. 200 B.C. - c. 300 A.D) saw the rise of many regional schools of art, as well as a few general trends that influenced all of them. These trends developed out of the previous Mauryan period, and went on to shape art for centuries afterwards.

One of the earliest regional schools of art was the Gandhara School of Art, which originated in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent. The Gandhara School focused heavily on Buddhist and Hindu iconography, with a Greco-Roman flavor that was derived from the works of the Bactrian kings. This style fused together the naturalism of Greek sculpture and the religious sensibilities of Hindu and Buddhist art, creating a unique hybrid visual style.

The Mathura school of art was another significant regional school during this period. Originating in the town of Mathura, this school focused much more on Hindu iconography than the Gandhara School. This art was much more abstract in nature and focused heavily on elegant, curvilinear lines and a colored palette that included blues, pinks, and reds.

The Amaravati School of Art was the third main regional school of this period. Located in the Deccan region at the mouth of the Krishna River, the Amaravati School was heavily influenced by Buddhist imagery and iconography. Art was heavily stylized and geometric in nature, making use of bold patterns and minimal figures.

In addition to these regional schools of art, there were also a few general trends that occurred throughout the post-Mauryan period. One such trend was the increasing popularity of painted murals and sculptures. Stone carving was also becoming increasingly popular, as were comical terracotta figures and pottery. These works depicted everything from everyday life to religious iconography.

The rise of regional schools of art alongside general trends in painting and sculpting cemented the post-Mauryan period as a major turning point in the history of Indian art. These schools and trends went on to influence art for centuries afterwards, and provided a basis for the further development of Indian art.
