It is recorded that in the **fourth** council in King **Kanishka**'s reign, there was a split in Buddhism to Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism.

The various school under Buddhism are :

## Hinayana Buddhism

- It means the lesser vehicle. Both the Hinayana and Mahayana terms were coined by the Mahayanists.
- It is more of an **orthodox** school did not believe in **idol** or **image** worship of Buddha

- One of the sub-sects of Hinayana is ==Sthaviravada or Theravada==
