Economy: The coins of the Guptas reflect the prosperity and stability of the Gupta economy, which was based on agriculture, trade, and mining. The Guptas issued a large number of gold coins, known as dinaras, which were of high quality and artistic excellence. The gold coins were used for international trade and royal donations, and indicate the availability and circulation of gold in the Gupta empire. The Guptas also issued silver coins, which were used for local trade and tribute, and show the influence of the Kushana and the Roman coins. The copper, bronze, and alloy metal coins, on the other hand, are scarce, and suggest that the use of money was not the common medium of exchange for the public, who relied more on barter and natural produce.

Polity: The coins of the Guptas reflect the political power and authority of the Gupta rulers, who claimed to be the descendants of the ancient Kshatriyas or the solar and lunar races. The coins of the Guptas bear the names, titles, and portraits of the Gupta kings, such as Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, Chandragupta II, Kumaragupta I, and Skandagupta, and depict their various achievements and attributes, such as conquests, victories, valour, piety, and generosity. The coins of the Guptas also show the extent and diversity of the Gupta empire, which covered most of northern and central India, and included various provinces, vassals, and allies. The coins of the Guptas also show the influence and interaction of the Guptas with other political entities, such as the Kushanas, the Sakas, the Romans, and the Huns.

Religion: The coins of the Guptas reflect the religious tolerance and patronage of the Gupta rulers, who followed Hinduism, but also respected and supported other religions, such as Buddhism, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism. The coins of the Guptas depict various Hindu gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Lakshmi, Durga, Kartikeya, and Ganga, and show the popularity and diversity of the Hindu pantheon and cults. The coins of the Guptas also depict various Buddhist and Jain symbols and images, such as the lion capital, the wheel, the stupa, the lotus, the bull, and the swastika, and show the influence and acceptance of these religions in the Gupta society and culture. The coins of the Guptas also depict some foreign deities and motifs, such as Mithra, Garuda, and the crescent, and show the contact and exchange of the Guptas with other religious traditions, such as Zoroastrianism and Islam.

Arts: The coins of the Guptas reflect the artistic excellence and innovation of the Gupta period, which is regarded as the golden age of Indian art and culture. The coins of the Guptas are the finest examples of numismatics and aesthetic perfection, and show the mastery and creativity of the Gupta craftsmen and artists. The coins of the Guptas are rich in design and variety, and depict various scenes and themes, such as hunting, playing, sacrificing, worshipping, and dancing. The coins of the Guptas are also remarkable for their realism and naturalism, and portray the features and expressions of the Gupta kings and deities with accuracy and elegance. The coins of the Guptas also show the influence and adaptation of the Gupta art and culture from other sources, such as the Kushana, the Roman, and the Greek art and culture.

```ad-Answer

The economic life in the age of the Guptas was prosperous and diverse, but also faced some challenges and decline. Some of the features of the economic life in the Gupta period are:

- Agriculture: Agriculture was the main occupation and source of income for most of the people. The Guptas encouraged irrigation works, land grants, and tax reforms to boost agricultural production. Various crops such as rice, wheat, barley, millets, pulses, sugarcane, cotton, and fruits were grown¹³⁵.
- Trade and commerce: Trade and commerce flourished both within and outside India during the Gupta period. The Guptas maintained trade relations with China, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Roman Empire. They also issued gold, silver, and copper coins, which facilitated trade and reflected their economic prosperity. The main items of trade were spices, textiles, gems, metals, ivory, and horses. The trade was carried out by land and sea routes, and was regulated by guilds and corporations¹²⁴⁵.
- Industry and crafts: Industry and crafts also developed during the Gupta period. Various industries such as iron, steel, copper, bronze, gold, silver, glass, pottery, and textiles were established. The craftsmen produced fine quality of goods such as iron pillars, bronze statues, gold ornaments, silk fabrics, and terracotta figurines. The artisans were organized into guilds and enjoyed patronage from the kings and the nobles¹⁴⁵.
- Mining and metallurgy: Mining and metallurgy were important sources of wealth and revenue for the Guptas. They exploited the rich mineral resources of India, such as gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, and zinc. They also developed advanced techniques of metallurgy, such as smelting, forging, casting, and alloying. The iron pillar of Delhi, the gold coins of the Guptas, and the silver vessels of the Kushanas are some of the examples of their metallurgical skills¹⁵⁶.
- Taxation and revenue: Taxation and revenue were the main sources of income for the Gupta administration. The Guptas levied various taxes on land, trade, industry, and professions. The land tax was the most important and was fixed at one-sixth of the produce. The trade tax was levied on the goods that were imported or exported. The industry tax was levied on the artisans and craftsmen. The profession tax was levied on the people who practiced different occupations. The taxes were collected by the officials and were deposited in the treasury¹²⁵.
- Economic decline: The economic life of the Guptas faced some challenges and decline towards the end of their rule. The main factors that contributed to their economic decline were:
  - The loss of western India to the Hunas and the Vakatakas, which deprived them of the rich revenues from trade and commerce.
  - The frequent invasions and wars, which drained their resources and disrupted their trade and agriculture⁶.
  - The decline in the quality and quantity of their gold coins, which indicated their financial crisis and loss of prestige.
  - The corruption and mismanagement of the officials, who exploited the people and embezzled the taxes.
  - The social and religious changes, which affected the economic activities and values of the people.

The economic life of the Guptas was based on a strong agrarian foundation, supplemented by trade, commerce, industry, and mining. Agriculture was the main occupation and source of income for most of the people. The Guptas encouraged irrigation works, land grants, and tax reforms to boost agricultural production. Various crops such as rice, wheat, barley, millets, pulses, sugarcane, cotton, and fruits were grown. The land was classified into different categories based on its fertility and ownership, and the land tax was fixed at one-sixth of the produce. The land grants were given to Brahmins, temples, monasteries, and officials, and were exempted from taxes and duties. The land grants also facilitated the spread of culture and administration to the remote areas.

Trade and commerce flourished both within and outside India during the Gupta period. The Guptas maintained trade relations with China, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Roman Empire. They also issued gold, silver, and copper coins, which facilitated trade and reflected their economic prosperity. The main items of trade were spices, textiles, gems, metals, ivory, and horses. The trade was carried out by land and sea routes, and was regulated by guilds and corporations. The guilds were associations of merchants, artisans, and craftsmen, who controlled the production, quality, and price of goods. The corporations were larger organizations of traders, who financed and organized long-distance trade. The trade and commerce also generated revenue for the state, as the Guptas levied various taxes and duties on the goods that were imported or exported.

Industry and crafts also developed during the Gupta period. Various industries such as iron, steel, copper, bronze, gold, silver, glass, pottery, and textiles were established. The craftsmen produced fine quality of goods such as iron pillars, bronze statues, gold ornaments, silk fabrics, and terracotta figurines. The artisans were organized into guilds and enjoyed patronage from the kings and the nobles. The industry and crafts also contributed to the artistic and cultural achievements of the Guptas, as they created masterpieces of sculpture, painting, architecture, and literature.

Mining and metallurgy were important sources of wealth and revenue for the Guptas. They exploited the rich mineral resources of India, such as gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, and zinc. They also developed advanced techniques of metallurgy, such as smelting, forging, casting, and alloying. The iron pillar of Delhi, the gold coins of the Guptas, and the silver vessels of the Kushanas are some of the examples of their metallurgical skills. The mining and metallurgy also supported the trade and commerce, as they supplied the raw materials and finished products for the domestic and foreign markets.

The economic prosperity of the Guptas was also reflected in the urbanization and standard of living of the people. The Guptas built and maintained many cities, such as Pataliputra, Ujjain, Prayaga, Mathura, Kanchi, and Taxila, which were centers of administration, trade, culture, and education. The cities were well-planned and had public amenities such as roads, bridges, markets, temples, monasteries, and universities. The people enjoyed a comfortable and luxurious life, as they had access to various goods and services, such as food, clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, entertainment, and education. The people also participated in various social and religious activities, such as festivals, fairs, pilgrimages, and donations.

The samanta system was a political institution that emerged in the early medieval period (4th to 12th century CE) in India, and was characterized by the relationship between a king and his vassals or tributaries. The term samanta means a neighbor or a borderer, and implies a degree of autonomy and independence. The samanta system is considered to be closely associated with the origin and growth of feudalism in India, as it involved the grant of land, privileges, and titles to the samantas in exchange for their loyalty, tribute, and military service to the king.

The origins of the samanta system can be traced back to the Gupta period (c. 320-550 CE), when the Gupta empire faced various challenges from internal rebellions, foreign invasions, and regional powers. The Gupta kings adopted a policy of conciliation and compromise with their rivals and adversaries, and granted them the status of samantas or subordinate rulers. The samantas were allowed to retain their own territories, administration, and army, but had to acknowledge the supremacy of the Gupta king, pay him tribute, and assist him in wars. The samantas also received land grants, titles, and honors from the Gupta king, and were expected to follow his orders and policies. The samanta system enabled the Gupta kings to maintain their hegemony and prestige, and to expand their empire through alliances and conquests.

The samanta system became more widespread and complex in the post-Gupta period (6th to 12th century CE), when the political scenario of India was marked by the emergence of numerous regional kingdoms, such as the Pallavas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Pratiharas, Pala, Sena, Cholas, and Chahamanas. These kingdoms competed and conflicted with each other for supremacy and resources, and also faced threats from foreign invaders, such as the Hunas, Arabs, Turks, and Afghans. The kings of these kingdoms adopted the samanta system as a means of expanding and consolidating their power and territory, and of coping with the political and military challenges. The kings granted land, revenue, and authority to their samantas, who were usually their relatives, nobles, generals, or local chiefs. The samantas, in turn, owed allegiance, tribute, and service to the king, and also granted land and privileges to their own subordinates, creating a hierarchy of feudal lords and vassals. The samanta system also involved the participation of the Brahmins, who received land grants and donations from the kings.

```ad-Answer

The condition of the common man in the Gupta period was not very favorable, despite the political and cultural achievements of the Gupta rulers. The common man, who belonged to the lower castes and classes, faced various hardships and inequalities in the society and economy.

The caste system, or varna system, had become rigid and hierarchical during the Gupta period, and the Brahmins occupied the top position in society. The Brahmins received lavish gifts from rulers and other wealthy people, and enjoyed various privileges and exemptions. The Kshatriyas, or the warriors and rulers, were the second in rank, and had the right to bear arms and administer justice. The Vaishyas, or the merchants and traders, were the third in rank, and had the right to engage in commerce and agriculture. The Shudras, or the servants and laborers, were the lowest in rank, and had no rights or freedoms. They had to serve the upper castes and pay heavy taxes and tributes. The untouchables, or the outcastes, were outside the varna system, and were considered impure and polluted. They had to perform the most menial and degrading jobs, and were subjected to social discrimination and oppression.

The economic condition of the common man was also poor and unstable during the Gupta period. The common man had to bear the burden of heavy taxation and land revenue, which were imposed by the rulers and the landlords. The common man had to pay various taxes, such as the bhaga, or the share of the produce, the bali, or the voluntary gift, the uparikara, or the additional tax, the pindakara, or the poll tax, the shulka, or the customs duty, and the hiranya, or the gold tax. The common man also had to pay various land revenues, such as the kara, or the rent, the bhoga, or the maintenance, the upabhoga, or the service, and the pranaya, or the tribute. The common man had no security of tenure or ownership of land, and was often exploited and oppressed by the landlords and the officials.

The social and cultural condition of the common man was also dismal and stagnant during the Gupta period. The common man had little access to education and learning, which were monopolized by the Brahmins and the upper castes. The common man had little exposure to the arts and sciences, which were patronized by the rulers and the wealthy people. The common man had little participation in the religious and cultural activities, which were dominated by the Brahmanical and orthodox traditions. The common man had little scope for innovation and creativity, which were discouraged by the rigid and conservative norms of the society.

Some examples of the condition of the common man in the Gupta period are:

- The common man had to suffer from the frequent invasions and wars, which disrupted the peace and security of the empire. The common man had to face the plunder and destruction of the invaders, such as the Hunas, the Sakas, and the Kushanas, who ravaged the towns and villages, and looted the wealth and resources of the people.
- The common man had to endure the natural calamities and famines, which affected the agriculture and the food supply of the empire. The common man had to face the droughts and floods, which damaged the crops and the irrigation systems, and caused starvation and disease among the people.
- The common man had to cope with the social and religious conflicts, which created divisions and tensions among the people. The common man had to face the discrimination and persecution of the Brahmins and the upper castes, who imposed their authority and ideology on the lower castes and classes. The common man had to face the opposition and hostility of the Buddhists and the Jains, who challenged the supremacy and validity of the Brahmanical and Hindu faith.

```ad-Answer

The use of gold coins by commoners in the Gupta period was very limited and rare, as gold coins were mainly used by the rulers, the nobles, the officials, and the merchants for high-value transactions and payments. The commoners mostly used silver coins, copper coins, or barter system for their local and daily exchange.

The Gupta emperors issued a large number of gold coins, known as dinars, which were of high quality and artistic excellence. The gold coins depicted the portraits and legends of the ruling king on the obverse, and a goddess or a symbol on the reverse. The gold coins also showed the influence of the Greek, Roman, and Central Asian cultures, as well as the Hindu and Buddhist religions. The gold coins were of various types and subtypes, such as the horseman type, the archer type, the king and queen type, the couch type, the lyrist type, the Garuda type, the lion-slayer type, and the Chhatra type[^1^][2].

The gold coins were used by the Gupta rulers to pay their officers in the army and administration, who were responsible for maintaining the law and order, collecting the taxes and revenues, and executing the royal orders. The gold coins were also used by the rulers to reward their loyal and brave soldiers, who fought in the wars and battles against the enemies and invaders. The gold coins were also used by the rulers to patronize the Brahmins, the scholars, the poets, and the artists, who contributed to the cultural and intellectual achievements of the Gupta period[^2^][3].

The gold coins were also used by the nobles and the wealthy people, who were the landowners, the landlords, the traders, and the bankers, who had large estates, properties, and businesses. The gold coins were used by them to buy and sell land, which was the main source of wealth and power in the Gupta period. The gold coins were also used by them to invest in trade and commerce, which were flourishing due to the political stability, the expansion of roads and ports, and the contacts with foreign countries. The gold coins were also used by them to display their status and prestige, by donating them to temples, monasteries, and charities[^2^][3].

The gold coins were not used by the commoners, who were the peasants, the artisans, the laborers, and the servants, who had low income and low social status. The gold coins were too expensive and scarce for them, as they had to pay heavy taxes and tributes to the rulers and the landlords, and had little surplus or savings. The commoners mostly used silver coins, copper coins, or barter system for their local and daily exchange. The silver coins were issued by the Guptas after the conquest of Gujarat, which was a rich and prosperous region. The copper coins were issued by the local and feudal rulers, who had some autonomy and authority in their regions. The barter system was used by the rural and tribal people, who exchanged their goods and services with each other

```ad-Answer

The second urbanization refers to the process of emergence and growth of cities and towns in ancient India from the 6th century BCE onwards, especially in the Gangetic plains and the Deccan plateau. This process was influenced by various factors, such as the rise of new political and religious movements, the expansion of trade and commerce, the development of agriculture and irrigation, the diffusion of iron technology, and the contact with foreign cultures.

The second urbanization gave rise to the organized corporate activities that reached their zenith during the Gupta period. Corporate activities are the economic and social activities that are carried out by the associations or groups of people, such as guilds, corporations, sanghas, ganas, etc. These associations were formed by the people who shared common interests, occupations, or identities, and who had some degree of autonomy and authority in their affairs.

Some of the features and examples of the corporate activities in the Gupta period are:

- The guilds were the associations of the artisans, craftsmen, and merchants, who specialized in various trades and industries, such as weaving, pottery, metalwork, ivory work, shipbuilding, etc. The guilds had their own rules, regulations, and codes of conduct, and they controlled the production, distribution, and quality of their goods and services. The guilds also acted as banks, lenders, and insurers, and they participated in the local and long-distance trade and commerce. The guilds also had their own seals, symbols, and inscriptions, which attested their identity and status. The guilds also donated to the temples, monasteries, and charities, and they patronized the arts and culture. Some of the examples of the guilds in the Gupta period are the silk weavers of Mandsor, the ivory workers of Bhita, the oil pressers of Eran, the stone cutters of Udayagiri, etc.

- The corporations were the associations of the landowners, landlords, and farmers, who owned and managed large estates, properties, and villages. The corporations had their own administration, judiciary, and military, and they collected and paid taxes and revenues to the rulers. The corporations also maintained the irrigation systems, roads, and bridges, and they provided security and welfare to their members and dependents. The corporations also had their own charters, grants, and inscriptions, which recorded their rights and privileges. The corporations also donated to the temples, monasteries, and charities, and they patronized the arts and culture. Some of the examples of the corporations in the Gupta period are the Nagara Shreshthi of Ujjain, the Sarthavaha of Mathura, the Agrahara of Nalanda, the Gahapati of Eran, etc.

- The sanghas and ganas were the associations of the tribal and rural people, who lived in the forests, hills, and plains. The sanghas and ganas had their own assemblies, councils, and chiefs, and they followed their own customs and traditions. The sanghas and ganas also resisted the encroachment and domination of the rulers and the landlords, and they asserted their autonomy and sovereignty. The sanghas and ganas also had their own coins, seals, and inscriptions, which expressed their identity and status. The sanghas and ganas also donated to the temples, monasteries, and charities, and they patronized the arts and culture. Some of the examples of the sanghas and ganas in the Gupta period are the Yaudheyas, the Malavas, the Abhiras, the Vakatakas, etc.

The Gupta period (c. 320-550 CE) is regarded as the golden age of Indian culture, as it witnessed remarkable achievements in the fields of religion, literature, and fine arts. Some of the features and examples of the development of these fields under the Guptas are:

- Religion: The Gupta rulers were tolerant and patronizing of various religious sects and movements, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and others. Hinduism, however, was the dominant religion, and it underwent a revival and reformation under the Guptas. The Gupta rulers adopted various forms of Hindu deities, such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi, as their royal emblems and cults, and they performed elaborate rituals and sacrifices, such as the Ashvamedha and the Vajapeya. The Gupta period also saw the development of the Puranas, the Smritis, and the Tantras, which codified the Hindu myths, laws, and practices. The Gupta period also witnessed the growth of the Bhakti movement, which emphasized the personal devotion and love of the devotees towards their chosen gods and goddesses. The Gupta period also saw the flourishing of Buddhism and Jainism, which received the patronage of the Gupta rulers and the wealthy merchants and traders. The Gupta period also saw the construction of numerous temples, monasteries, stupas, and caves, which reflected the architectural and sculptural excellence of the Gupta period. Some of the examples of the religious monuments of the Gupta period are the Dashavatara temple at Deogarh, the Vishnu temple at Tigawa, the Udayagiri caves near Vidisha, the Ajanta and Ellora caves in Maharashtra, the Sanchi stupa in Madhya Pradesh, etc.

- Literature: The Gupta period is considered as the classical age of Sanskrit literature, as it produced some of the finest poets, dramatists, and scholars, who enriched the language and the literature with their creativity and erudition. The Gupta rulers themselves were patrons and authors of Sanskrit literature, and they encouraged the development of various genres and styles, such as poetry, drama, prose, biography, history, grammar, lexicography, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, etc. The Gupta period also saw the development of Prakrit and Pali literature, which were the languages of the common people and the religious sects. The Gupta period also saw the translation and transmission of Indian literature to other regions and cultures, such as China, Tibet, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. Some of the examples of the literary works and authors of the Gupta period are the Abhijnanashakuntala, the Malavikagnimitra, and the Vikramorvashiyam by Kalidasa, the Mudrarakshasa and the Devichandraguptam by Vishakhadatta, the Harshacharita and the Kadambari by Banabhatta, the Aryabhatiya by Aryabhata, the Suryasiddhanta by Varahamihira, the Ashtadhyayi by Panini, the Amarakosha by Amarasimha, the Buddhacharita and the Saundarananda by Ashvaghosha, the Mahavamsa and the Dipavamsa by the Pali chroniclers, etc.

- Fine Arts: The Gupta period is regarded as the zenith of Indian art, as it witnessed the development of various forms and expressions of art, such as painting, sculpture, architecture, music, dance, etc. The Gupta art was characterized by its grace, elegance, refinement, and realism, and it reflected the religious, cultural, and aesthetic values of the Gupta period. The Gupta art also influenced and inspired the art of other regions and cultures, such as Nepal, Tibet, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. Some of the examples of the fine arts of the Gupta period are the paintings of Ajanta, which depict the life and teachings of the Buddha and the Jataka stories, the sculptures of Sarnath, which portray the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas in various poses and expressions, the sculptures of Mathura, which depict the Hindu and Jain deities and the secular themes, the sculptures of Gandhara, which show the influence of the Greco-Roman art, the temples of Deogarh, Tigawa, and Bhitargaon, which exhibit the Nagara style of architecture, the caves of Udayagiri, Ajanta, and Ellora, which display the rock-cut architecture, the music and dance of the Gupta period, which were influenced by the Natyashastra of Bharata and the Sangitaratnakara of Sarangadeva, etc .

1. Discuss the ancient Indian contacts with South-East Asia with reference to causes, chronology and original home of the migrants. What was the impact of these contacts on the art of Kambuja and Java? [1980, 60m]

```ad-Answer

Ancient Indian contacts with South-East Asia can be traced back to the prehistoric times, when maritime trade and migration facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and people between the two regions. The causes of these contacts were mainly economic, religious, and political, and the chronology of these contacts can be divided into four phases: the pre-Mauryan phase (c. 6th-3rd century BCE), the Mauryan phase (c. 3rd-2nd century BCE), the post-Mauryan phase (c. 2nd century BCE-3rd century CE), and the Gupta phase (c. 4th-6th century CE). The original home of the migrants varied according to the regions and periods, but some of the prominent sources of migration were Bengal, Orissa, Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Malabar. The impact of these contacts on the art of Kambuja (Cambodia) and Java (Indonesia) was profound and lasting, as they adopted and adapted various forms and styles of Indian art, such as architecture, sculpture, painting, and iconography.

Some of the salient points of the trade are : 

- The pre-Mauryan phase witnessed the establishment of the first Indian settlements and colonies in South-East Asia, such as Tamralipti in Burma, Suvarnabhumi in Thailand, Funan in Cambodia, and Yavadvipa in Java. These settlements were mainly engaged in trade and commerce, and they introduced Indian products, such as cotton, spices, gems, and metals, to the local markets. They also introduced Indian scripts, such as Brahmi and Kharoshthi, and Indian religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, to the local people. The art of this phase was mainly influenced by the Mauryan and post-Mauryan art of India, and it reflected the simplicity, naturalism, and realism of these styles. Some of the examples of the art of this phase are the Buddha images of Burma and Thailand, the stupa of Batujaya in Java, and the brick temples of Funan in Cambodia.

- The Mauryan phase saw the expansion of the Indian influence and authority in South-East Asia, as the Mauryan emperor Ashoka sent his missionaries and emissaries to various regions, such as Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia, to propagate Buddhism and his Dhamma. The Mauryan phase also saw the development of the maritime trade and navigation, as the Indian merchants and sailors explored new routes and ports, such as Kattigara in Vietnam, Oc Eo in Cambodia, and Barus in Sumatra. The art of this phase was mainly influenced by the Gandhara and Mathura art of India, and it reflected the syncretism, diversity, and sophistication of these styles. Some of the examples of the art of this phase are the Buddha images of Dvaravati in Thailand, the stupa of Borobudur in Java, and the stone sculptures of Oc Eo in Cambodia.

- The post-Mauryan phase witnessed the consolidation and integration of the Indian culture and civilization in South-East Asia, as the local rulers and elites adopted and adapted various aspects of the Indian political, social, and religious systems, such as the concept of chakravartin, the varna and caste system, the Sanskrit language and literature, and the Hindu and Buddhist pantheons and rituals. The post-Mauryan phase also saw the emergence and flourishing of the indigenous kingdoms and dynasties in South-East Asia, such as the Pyu in Burma, the Mon in Thailand, the Chenla in Cambodia, and the Srivijaya in Indonesia, which maintained close and cordial relations with the Indian kingdoms and dynasties, such as the Satavahanas, the Kushanas, the Guptas, and the Pallavas. The art of this phase was mainly influenced by the Gupta and post-Gupta art of India, and it reflected the grace, elegance, refinement, and idealism of these styles. Some of the examples of the art of this phase are the Buddha images of Pyu and Mon in Burma and Thailand, the Shiva and Vishnu images of Chenla in Cambodia, and the Hindu and Buddhist temples of Srivijaya in Indonesia.

- The Gupta phase marked the peak and decline of the Indian influence and presence in South-East Asia, as the Gupta empire reached its zenith and then collapsed under the pressure of the Hun invasions and internal conflicts. The Gupta phase also saw the rise and expansion of the new and powerful kingdoms and empires in South-East Asia, such as the Pagan in Burma, the Haripunjaya in Thailand, the Angkor in Cambodia, and the Sailendra and Mataram in Indonesia, which challenged and replaced the Indian hegemony and influence in the region. The Gupta phase also saw the development and diversification of the trade and cultural contacts between India and South-East Asia, as the Indian merchants and travelers visited and settled in various regions, such as Champa in Vietnam, Kedah in Malaysia, and Bali in Indonesia, and the South-East Asian rulers and pilgrims visited and patronized various regions, such as Nalanda in Bihar, Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, and Kedarnath in Uttarakhand. The art of this phase was mainly influenced by the Pallava and Chalukya art of India, and it reflected the grandeur, magnificence, innovation, and dynamism of these styles. Some of the examples of the art of this phase are the Buddha images of Pagan and Haripunjaya in Burma and Thailand, the Shiva and Vishnu temples of Angkor in Cambodia, and the Hindu and Buddhist monuments of Sailendra and Mataram in Indonesia.

The cultural impact of India on South-East Asia during the ancient period was immense and multifaceted, as India transmitted and shared various aspects of its civilization and culture, such as language, literature, religion, philosophy, art, architecture, science, technology, law, administration, and social organization, with the South-East Asian countries, such as Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The cultural impact of India on South-East Asia was not a result of invasion or colonization, but rather a result of peaceful and voluntary interaction and exchange, based on mutual respect and benefit, between the Indian and South-East Asian people, through trade, migration, diplomacy, and pilgrimage. The cultural impact of India on South-East Asia was not a one-way or uniform process, but rather a two-way and diverse process, as India also received and assimilated various aspects of the South-East Asian civilization and culture, such as products, plants, animals, customs, and legends, and as South-East Asia also preserved and developed its own indigenous civilization and culture, along with the Indian elements.

Some of the salient points of the answer are:

- The cultural impact of India on South-East Asia was facilitated by the geographical proximity and the maritime connectivity between the two regions, as the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal provided the natural routes and ports for the trade and cultural contacts. The trade between India and South-East Asia was mainly driven by the demand and supply of various commodities, such as spices, aromatics, textiles, metals, gems, and pearls, and it involved the participation and cooperation of various merchants, sailors, guilds, and kingdoms, from both sides. The trade also led to the migration and settlement of various Indian people, such as traders, artisans, priests, teachers, and adventurers, in various South-East Asian regions, such as Suvarnabhumi, Funan, Srivijaya, and Kedah, where they established their colonies, communities, and institutions, and interacted with the local people.

- The cultural impact of India on South-East Asia was also influenced by the religious and philosophical ideas and practices of India, especially Hinduism and Buddhism, which were introduced and propagated by various Indian missionaries, emissaries, and pilgrims, such as Ashoka's Dhamma Mahamattas, Kaundinya's Brahmanas, and Atisha's Bodhisattvas, in various South-East Asian regions, such as Dvaravati, Chenla, Angkor, and Borobudur, where they converted and instructed the local rulers, elites, and masses, and established their temples, monasteries, and schools. Hinduism and Buddhism provided the South-East Asian people with a new worldview, a new ethical code, a new ritual system, and a new artistic inspiration, and they also coexisted and syncretized with the local animistic and ancestral beliefs and practices.

- The cultural impact of India on South-East Asia was also reflected by the linguistic and literary expressions and achievements of India, especially Sanskrit, which was adopted and adapted by various South-East Asian rulers, elites, and scholars, as the language of administration, diplomacy, religion, and literature, and as the medium of transmission and translation of various Indian texts, such as the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Arthashastra, and the Manu Smriti, in various South-East Asian regions, such as Kambuja, Java, Bali, and Sumatra, where they composed and inscribed their own texts, such as the inscriptions, the chronicles, the poems, and the epics, using various scripts, such as the Pallava, the Kawi, the Nagari, and the Khmer.

- The cultural impact of India on South-East Asia was also manifested by the artistic and architectural creations and innovations of India, especially the Hindu and Buddhist art and architecture, which were imitated and modified by various South-East Asian artists, architects, and patrons, as the forms and styles of expression, representation, and decoration, and as the symbols and models of power, devotion, and glory, in various South-East Asian regions, such as Pagan, Haripunjaya, Angkor Wat, and Prambanan, where they built and embellished their own monuments, such as the stupas, the temples, the statues, and the reliefs, using various materials, such as the brick, the stone, the bronze, and the gold.

Vedic religion was the religion of the ancient Indo-European-speaking peoples who entered India about 1500 BCE from the region of present-day Iran12. It was based on the collections of sacred texts known as the Vedas, which were composed and handed down orally over a period of about 10 centuries3. The religion of the Gupta period, on the other hand, was influenced by various traditions that emerged after the Vedic period, such as Buddhism, Jainism, Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Bhagavatism45.

Vedic religion was mainly focused on the performance of rituals and sacrifices to appease the gods, who were personifications of natural forces and phenomena12. The religion of the Gupta period was more devotional and philosophical, emphasizing the worship of personal deities, such as Vishnu and Shiva, and the concepts of karma, dharma, and moksha45.

Vedic religion was largely exclusive to the Brahmins, the priestly class, who had the authority to interpret and transmit the Vedas12. The religion of the Gupta period was more inclusive and assimilated the lower classes and the non-Aryan peoples into its fold5. It also gave rise to various sects and movements, such as the Bhakti movement, that challenged the Brahminical orthodoxy4

Gupta art is the art of the Gupta Empire, which ruled most of northern India from about 300 to 480 CE1. It is considered as one of the peaks of classical Indian art, and influenced later Indian art traditions1. Some of the characteristics of Gupta art are:

It is marked by refinement, elegance, simplicity, and spiritual purpose23. It shows a high degree of cultural taste and aesthetic enjoyment23.

It is mainly focused on religious sculpture, especially of Buddha and Hindu deities such as Vishnu and Shiva1. The sculptures are made of stone, metal, or terracotta, and show a mastery of anatomy, proportion, expression, and movement14.

It has a distinctive style of depicting the human figure, with ornate halos, thin drapery, specific hair curls, meditative eyes, elongated earlobes, thick lower lips, and three lines across the neck1. The figures have a soft and pliant body that conveys grace and serenity.

It shows a fusion of Indian and foreign influences, such as Greek, Roman, Persian, and Central Asian styles12. For example, the Buddha images from Mathura and Gandhara show the influence of Hellenistic art in their facial features, drapery, and posture.

It depicts a variety of themes and subjects, such as mythology, legends, history, and daily life12. For example, the Ajanta cave paintings illustrate scenes from the Jataka tales, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the life of the Buddha.

It demonstrates a high level of technical skill and artistic creativity in various mediums, such as stone, metal, terracotta, wood, and paint. For example, the iron pillar of Delhi is a remarkable example of metallurgy, as it has not rusted for over 1500 years.

Maurya art was mainly influenced by Persian and Greek art, while Gupta art was more indigenous and original12.
Maurya art was mostly made of wood, stone, metal, and ivory, while Gupta art used more diverse materials, such as terracotta, paint, plaster, and glass.

Nalanda Mahavihara was a famous Buddhist monastic and academic institution that flourished in ancient India from the 3rd century BCE to the 13th century CE. It was located in the kingdom of Magadha, near the city of Rajagriha (now Rajgir), and about 90 kilometres (56 mi) southeast of Pataliputra (now Patna) 1. It is considered by historians to be the world’s first residential university and among the greatest centers of learning in the ancient world1.

The name Nalanda means “giver of knowledge” or “insatiable in giving” in Sanskrit1. The site of Nalanda Mahavihara comprises the archaeological remains of stupas, shrines, viharas (residential and educational buildings), and important art works in stucco, stone, and metal2. The site covers an area of about 14 hectares and is surrounded by a brick wall2. The layout of the site reflects the organized and hierarchical nature of the institution, with the main temple in the center, the viharas arranged in rows, and the stupas and shrines scattered around2.

Nalanda Mahavihara was founded by the Kushan king Kumaragupta I in the 5th century CE, according to a Tibetan source1. However, some scholars suggest that it may have existed earlier, as there are references to Nalanda in the Pali canon and the Jataka tales1. Nalanda Mahavihara was patronized by various rulers, such as the Gupta, the Pala, and the Sena dynasties, as well as by foreign kings, such as Harshavardhana of Kannauj and Balaputradeva of Sumatra1. Nalanda Mahavihara also received donations and gifts from pilgrims, merchants, and monks from different regions and countries1.

Nalanda Mahavihara was a center of excellence for Buddhist studies, especially the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions1. It also offered courses in various subjects, such as logic, grammar, medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy1. It had a library that contained thousands of manuscripts and texts, some of which were written on palm leaves and some on copper plates1. The library was divided into three buildings, called Ratnasagara, Ratnadadhi, and Ratnaranjaka, meaning “Ocean of Jewels”, “Sea of Jewels”, and “Jewel-adorned” respectively1.

Nalanda Mahavihara attracted students and scholars from various parts of India, as well as from China, Tibet, Korea, Japan, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia1. Some of the famous alumni and faculty of Nalanda Mahavihara include Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Dignaga, Dharmakirti, Shantarakshita, Padmasambhava, Atisha, Naropa, Tilopa, Sariputra, Mahakasyapa, and Mahavira1. Some of the famous pilgrims and travelers who visited Nalanda Mahavihara include Faxian, Xuanzang, Yijing, Dharmasvamin, and Al-Biruni1.

Nalanda Mahavihara declined and was destroyed in the 12th century CE, due to the invasion of the Muslim armies led by Bakhtiyar Khilji1.

Indian culture spread to the South East Asian countries mainly through trade, migration and religion. One of the biggest factors for the spread of Indian culture was through trade, as Indian merchants and sailors established contacts and settlements with various regions such as Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam1. Some of these regions also became tributaries or allies of Indian kingdoms, such as Funan, which was a vassal state of Pallava dynasty2. Migration was another factor, as some Indians moved to South East Asia and intermarried with the local population. Geneticist Razib Khan believes that Indian civilization in Southeast Asia was spread not only through diffusion by traders, but by the migration of significant numbers of Indians. There is some evidence that some of the ruling class of Funan came from India, in addition to also containing local aristocrats32. Religion played a major role in spreading Indian culture, as Hinduism and Buddhism were adopted by many South East Asian kingdoms and influenced their art, architecture, literature and law. Some of the prominent examples are Angkor Wat in Cambodia, Borobudur in Indonesia, Sukhothai in Thailand and My Son in Vietnam45. The spread of Indian culture also involved cultural exchange and adaptation, as South East Asians incorporated their own beliefs and traditions into their versions of Hinduism and Buddhism.

The Gupta-Vakataka period is generally regarded as a golden age of Indian art and architecture for all the major religious groups. Most of the art and architecture were inspired by religion1. Here are some of the experimentations with art and architecture during this period:

Rock-cut temples at Ajanta and Elephanta: These are prominent sites that showcase a rich and complex art history of the Gupta period. They feature elaborate paintings, sculptures, and carvings depicting various themes from Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism2.
Buddhist stupas: These are hemispherical structures that contain relics of Buddha or other Buddhist saints. They were built as places of worship and pilgrimage. Some of the famous stupas from this period are Sanchi, Bharhut, Amaravati, and Nagarjunakonda3.
Cave and temple architecture: The Gupta period witnessed the development of new temple styles, such as Nagara, Dravida, Vesara, etc. These styles differed in their plan, elevation, ornamentation, etc. The temples were built with stone or brick and had flat or curved roofs. Some of the examples are Dashavatara temple at Deogarh, Vishnu temple at Tigawa, Parvati temple at Nachna Kuthara4.
Mathura and Gandhara schools of art: These are two distinct styles of sculpting that flourished during this period. The Mathura school was more indigenous and used red sandstone to depict Buddha and other deities in a naturalistic manner. The Gandhara school was influenced by Greek and Roman art and used grey schist to depict Buddha and other figures in a realistic manner with drapery and curly hair4.
Gupta coinage: The Gupta rulers issued the largest number of gold coins in ancient India. They depicted various aspects of their personality, achievements, titles, etc. on their coins. Some of the famous coins are Ashvamedha type (showing horse sacrifice), Lyrist type (showing king playing veena), Archer type (showing king holding bow), etc.
