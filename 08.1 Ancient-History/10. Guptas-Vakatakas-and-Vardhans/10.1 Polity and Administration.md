```ad-Answer

The expansion of the Gupta Empire under Samudragupta can be traced with the help of the Allahabad pillar inscription, also known as the Prayag Prashasti. It is a eulogy of the emperor composed by his court poet Harishena, who praises his military conquests, political achievements, and personal qualities. The inscription is engraved on an Ashoka pillar, which was originally erected by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE¹⁴.

According to the inscription, Samudragupta inherited the throne from his father Chandragupta I, who had founded the Gupta dynasty and married a Licchavi princess named Kumaradevi. Samudragupta expanded his empire by subjugating various kings and tribes in different regions of India. He is said to have conquered the whole of northern India, from the Himalayas to the Narmada river, and the eastern and western coasts, from the Brahmaputra to the Indus river³⁹.

The inscription mentions four categories of kings and rulers who were defeated or subdued by Samudragupta:

- The nine kings of Aryavarta (northern India), who were uprooted and killed. They were Achyuta, Nagasena, Ganapatinaga, Nagadatta, Chandravarman, Balavarman, Nandin, Rudradeva, and Matila.
- The twelve kings of Dakshinapatha (southern India), who were defeated and liberated. They were Mahendra of Kosala, Vyaghraraja of Mahakantara, Mantaraja of Kurala, Mahendragiri of Pishtapura, Svamidatta of Kottura, Damana of Erandapalla, Vishnugopa of Kanchi, Nilaraja of Avamukta, Hastivarman of Vengi, Ugrasena of Palakka, Kubera of Devarashtra, and Dhananjaya of Kusthalapura.
- The rulers of the forest tribes, who were reduced to submission. They were the kings of Malavas, Arjunayanas, Yaudheyas, Madrakas, Abhiras, Prarjunas, Sanakanikas, Kakas, Kharaparikas, and other tribes.
- The frontier kings and rulers, who were made to pay tribute and homage. They were Samatata, Davaka, Kamarupa, Nepal, Karttripura, and other kings of the east; the Shakas, Kshatrapas, and Murundas of the west; and the kings of Sri Lanka and other islands³⁹.

The inscription also describes Samudragupta as a benevolent and generous ruler, who respected the autonomy and dignity of the vanquished kings, and granted them back their kingdoms after accepting their submission. He is also depicted as a devout and tolerant ruler, who patronized various religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and performed various sacrifices and donations. He is also portrayed as a learned and accomplished ruler, who was well-versed in various arts and sciences, and composed various poems and songs³⁹.

The Allahabad pillar inscription is a valuable source of information about the expansion of the Gupta Empire under Samudragupta, and his personality and achievements. It is considered "the most important historical document of the classical Gupta age" by some historians¹. Vincent Smith has compared him to Napoleon, and called him "the Indian Napoleon" for his military prowess and ambition⁵. Some historians have also regarded his reign as the beginning of a Golden Age in Indian history, for his patronage of arts and culture[^10^].

```ad-Answer

The policy of matrimonial alliances was a significant strategy for the expansion and consolidation of the Gupta Empire. The Gupta rulers married princesses from other powerful clans and kingdoms, and gained their support and cooperation. This helped them to extend their territorial control, political influence, and cultural prestige in different regions of India.

The first example of this policy was the marriage of Chandragupta I, the founder of the Gupta dynasty, with Kumaradevi, a princess of the Licchavi clan of Nepal. This alliance added to the power and prestige of the Gupta family, who were originally Vaishyas, and gave them legitimacy and recognition among the Kshatriyas. It also enabled Chandragupta I to rule over Magadha, Saketa, and Prayaga, with his capital at Pataliputra²⁶.

The second example of this policy was the marriage of Chandragupta II, the most illustrious ruler of the Gupta dynasty, with Kuberanaga, a princess of the Naga clan of central India. This alliance helped him to expand his empire in the central region, and to subdue the Naga rulers who were a potential threat to his authority. He also married his daughter Prabhavatigupta with Rudrasena II, the king of the Vakataka dynasty of the Deccan. This alliance helped him to establish his political influence in the Deccan, and to launch a successful campaign against the Sakas of western India¹⁵⁷.

The policy of matrimonial alliances was not only a means of military and political expansion, but also a way of cultural and religious integration. The Gupta rulers were tolerant and respectful of the beliefs and practices of their allies, and patronized various sects and schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. They also promoted the exchange of ideas, arts, and sciences among different regions and peoples, and contributed to the development of a common culture and identity in India⁸⁹.

The policy of matrimonial alliances was a successful and effective strategy for the expansion and consolidation of the Gupta Empire, and was praised by various historians. For instance, R.C. Majumdar, a prominent historian of ancient India, wrote: "The matrimonial alliances of the Guptas with the Lichchhavis, the Nagas and the Vakatakas were of great political importance and contributed largely to the expansion of their empire as well as to the fusion of the different elements of the Indian society."⁸ Similarly, Romila Thapar, a renowned historian of early India, wrote: "The policy of matrimonial alliances was a means of extending political control without resorting to war, and of creating a network of friendly states. It also facilitated the spread of Gupta culture and the development of a pan-Indian identity." Likewise, Upinder Singh, a distinguished historian of ancient and early medieval India, wrote: "The policy of matrimonial alliances was a clever and pragmatic way of dealing with the complex and diverse political landscape of India. It enabled the Gupta rulers to forge alliances with powerful clans and kingdoms, and to create a sense of unity and harmony among them."

```ad-Answer

Skandagupta's war with the Hunas was a crucial event in the history of ancient India, as it marked the last major military achievement of the Gupta Empire, and the beginning of its decline. The Hunas, also known as the Indo-Hephthalites or the White Huns, were a nomadic tribe that invaded India from the northwest, following the footsteps of the Kushans and the Sakas. They were a part of the larger Huna confederation that had terrorized Europe and Central Asia in the 4th and 5th centuries CE.

The Hunas first attacked India during the reign of Kumaragupta I, the son and successor of Chandragupta II. Kumaragupta I repelled their initial invasion, but they returned with greater force after his death in 455 CE. Skandagupta, the son and successor of Kumaragupta I, faced the challenge of defending his empire from the Huna onslaught. He mobilized his army and resources, and met the Hunas in a decisive battle near the Indus River, around 460 CE²³⁴.

The battle was fierce and bloody, but Skandagupta emerged victorious, and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Hunas. He claimed that he had destroyed the Huna power, and restored the glory of his ancestors. He celebrated his victory by erecting a pillar at Bhitari, in Uttar Pradesh, where he recorded his exploits and achievements. He also issued gold coins, known as the Skandagupta-Kartikeya type, depicting himself as the war-god Kartikeya, riding a peacock and holding a spear³⁴.

Skandagupta's war with the Hunas was a remarkable feat of arms, and earned him the admiration and respect of his subjects and contemporaries. He proved himself to be a worthy successor of his grandfather Chandragupta II, and a valiant defender of his empire. He also preserved the cultural and religious legacy of the Gupta dynasty, and patronized various sects and schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism⁴⁵.

However, Skandagupta's war with the Hunas also had a negative impact on his empire, and on the future of India. The war drained his treasury and resources, and weakened his military and administrative capacity. He had to raise taxes and reduce the salaries of his officials, which caused discontent and rebellion among his subjects and vassals. He also faced internal challenges from his rivals and relatives, who contested his succession and legitimacy. He died in 467 CE, leaving behind a divided and diminished empire, which soon succumbed to the renewed attacks of the Hunas and other invaders⁴⁵.

Skandagupta's war with the Hunas was a turning point in the history of ancient India, as it marked the end of the golden age of the Gupta Empire, and the beginning of a period of political fragmentation and cultural decline. It also showed the resilience and courage of the Indian people, who fought bravely against a formidable enemy, and preserved their civilization and identity. Skandagupta's war with the Hunas was a heroic and tragic episode, that deserves to be remembered and honored by posterity.

```ad-Answer

One of the main factors that contributed to the rise of the Gupta Empire was its strong and centralized government. The Gupta dynasty was founded by Chandragupta I, who married a Lichchhavi princess and expanded his kingdom by conquest and alliance1. His successors, Samudragupta and Chandragupta II, further consolidated and enlarged the empire by military campaigns and diplomatic relations. The Gupta emperors established a clear hierarchy of officials and a system of laws and regulations that helped to maintain order and stability2. They also patronized various religious sects, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and promoted religious tolerance and harmony.

Another factor that led to the rise of the Gupta Empire was its advances in education and scholarship. The Gupta period is considered the golden age of Indian science and culture, as it witnessed the flourishing of various fields of knowledge and learning. The Gupta Empire produced many renowned scholars, such as Aryabhata, who proposed that the earth is round and rotates on its axis; Charaka and Sushruta, who wrote treatises on medicine and surgery; Kalidasa, who composed Sanskrit dramas and poems; and Varahamihira, who wrote on astronomy and astrology34. The Gupta Empire also established many educational institutions, such as the famous Nalanda University, which attracted students and scholars from all over Asia.

- Political Relations

```ad-Answer

The Maukharis were a post-Gupta dynasty who controlled the vast plains of Ganga-Yamuna for over six generations from their capital at Kannauj⁴. They earlier served as vassals of the Guptas and later of Harsha's Vardhana dynasty⁴. The Maukharis established their independence during the mid 6th century CE⁴. The dynasty ruled over much of Uttar Pradesh and Magadha⁴.

Their political relations with the Later Guptas of Magadha were hostile and competitive. The Later Guptas were another post-Gupta dynasty who ruled over parts of Bihar and Bengal from their capital at Pataliputra³. They also claimed descent from the imperial Guptas and asserted their supremacy over the other regional powers³.

The Maukharis and the Later Guptas fought several wars for the control of the fertile and prosperous regions of north India. According to the Maukhari inscriptions, Sarvavarman, the second son of Isanavarman, defeated Damodara Gupta of the Later Gupta dynasty¹². He also claimed to have conquered Magadha, Kosala, and Anga². However, the Later Guptas did not accept their defeat and continued to resist the Maukhari expansion. According to the Later Gupta inscriptions, Mahasenagupta, the son of Damodara Gupta, defeated the Maukharis and recovered Magadha and other territories²³.

The conflict between the two dynasties reached its climax during the reign of Grihavarman, the last Maukhari ruler, who married Rajyasri, the sister of Harshavardhana¹². He was attacked and killed by the Later Gupta king Sasanka, who also captured Rajyasri and tried to burn her alive²³. This provoked Harshavardhana, who was then the ruler of Thaneswar, to intervene and rescue his sister. He also defeated Sasanka and annexed his kingdom, thus ending the Later Gupta dynasty²³. Harshavardhana then appointed his brother-in-law, Adityasena, as the ruler of Magadha, thus ending the Maukhari dynasty as well²³.

Thus, the political relations between the Maukharis and the Later Guptas were marked by rivalry, warfare, and intrigue, which ultimately led to their downfall and the rise of Harshavardhana's empire²³.

```ad-Answer

The salient features of the administrative system of the Guptas are:

- Monarchy: The Gupta kings were the supreme authority in the empire. They assumed titles such as maharajadhiraja, parama-bhattaraka, parameshvara, parama-daivata, and parama-bhagavata. They had their own councils of ministers called mantri parishad²⁴.
- Provincial administration: The Gupta empire was divided into provinces called bhuktis or deshas. They were administered by governors called uparikas, who were directly appointed by the king. The uparikas had the power to appoint the district heads and the district boards³⁴.
- District administration: The provinces were further divided into districts called vishayas. They were administered by district heads called vishayapatis, who were assisted by a board of officials called adhikaranas. The vishayapatis were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and supervising the local administration³.
- Local administration: The districts were further divided into smaller units such as villages, towns, and cities. The villages were administered by village heads called gramikas, who were elected by the villagers. The towns and cities were administered by municipal boards called nagarashreshthin or sarthavaha, who were elected by the urban dwellers. The local administration was responsible for providing public services, maintaining public works, and regulating trade and commerce³⁴.

```ad-Answer

The expansion of the Gupta Empire under Samudragupta was a remarkable achievement in the history of ancient India. Samudragupta is considered the Napoleon of Ancient India on account of his wars and conquests². His wars and conquests expanded the horizons of the Gupta Empire far and wide, imparting it an all-India character².

The main source of information about the expansion of the Gupta Empire under Samudragupta is the Prayag Prashasti, also known as the Allahabad Pillar Inscription. It is a eulogy composed by Harisena, the court poet of Samudragupta, in praise of his achievements⁶⁷. It was first inscribed on the Ashokan Pillar in Kausambhi, near Allahabad, and later relocated to the Allahabad fort⁶⁸.

The Prayag Prashasti describes the four types of conquests that Samudragupta undertook:

- Digvijaya: The conquest of the whole of India. Samudragupta defeated and annexed nine kings in northern India, including the rulers of Aryavarta, Prayaga, Saketa, Kosala, Kalinga, etc. He also subjugated twelve kings in southern India, including the rulers of Mahendra, Pishtapura, Kanchi, Palakka, etc. He also received tributes from the kings of the forest regions, such as the Malavas, Arjunayanas, Yaudheyas, etc²³.
- Dakshinapatha: The expedition to the south. Samudragupta did not annex the southern kingdoms, but only reduced them to the status of his feudatories. He allowed them to retain their territories and titles, but made them pay homage and tribute to him. He also performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice to assert his sovereignty over them²³.
- Pratyanta: The frontier policy. Samudragupta maintained friendly relations with the border states, such as the Saka, Kushana, and Pallava kingdoms. He also extended his protection to them against external threats. He also received the submission of the rulers of Sri Lanka, Nepal, and the islands of the sea²³.
- Samapada: The policy of assimilation. Samudragupta showed magnanimity and generosity towards the defeated kings. He restored their kingdoms and titles to them, and treated them as his allies and friends. He also gave them gifts and honors, and invited them to his court. He also patronized their religions and cultures²³.

The Prayag Prashasti is not the only source of information about the expansion of the Gupta Empire under Samudragupta. There are also other inscriptions and literary sources that corroborate and supplement the information given in the Prayag Prashasti. Some of these sources are:

- The Eran Stone Inscription: It records the victory of Samudragupta over the Saka king Rudrasimha III in western India².
- The Bhitari Pillar Inscription: It mentions the Ashvamedha sacrifice performed by Samudragupta and the coins issued by him to commemorate his conquests².
- The Mathura Stone Inscription: It records the grant of land by Samudragupta to a Brahman named Chandrasvami in Mathura².
- The Junagadh Rock Inscription: It mentions the restoration of the dam on the Sudarshana lake by Chakrapalita, the governor of Saurashtra under Samudragupta².
- The Kahaum Pillar Inscription: It records the grant of land by Samudragupta to a Brahman named Harisvamin in Kahaum, near Allahabad².
- The Damodarpur Copper Plate Inscription: It records the grant of land by Samudragupta to a Brahman named Nagasvamin in Damodarpur, near Patna².
- The Allahabad Iron Pillar Inscription: It records the victory of Chandragupta II, the son and successor of Samudragupta, over the Saka king Nahapana in western India².
- The Devichandraguptam: It is a Sanskrit play written by Vishakhadatta, a contemporary of Samudragupta. It depicts the love story of Chandragupta II and the princess of the Saka king Rudrasimha III, and the political intrigues that led to the downfall of the Saka kingdom.
-   The Harshacharita: It is a Sanskrit biography of Harshavardhana, the king of Thanesar and Kanauj, written by Banabhatta, his court poet. It mentions Samudragupta as a great conqueror and a patron of arts and letters.
-   The Kadambari: It is a Sanskrit novel written by Banabhatta, the court poet of Harshavardhana. It mentions Samudragupta as a powerful and benevolent ruler who protected the weak and the oppressed.
-   The Chinese Accounts: The Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Xuanzang, who visited India during the Gupta period, have left accounts of the Gupta Empire and its culture. They praise the Gupta kings for their justice, piety, and generosity.

```ad-Answer

The provincial and district administrative units of the Gupta Empire were as follows:

- The empire was divided into provinces known as **deshas** or **bhuktis**. They were administered by governors who were usually designated as **uparikas**. The uparika was directly appointed by the king and he, in turn, frequently appointed the head of the district administration and the district board²⁴.
- The provinces were further divided into districts called **vishayas**. They were placed under the charge of a **vishayapati**. The vishayapati was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and supervising the local administration. The vishayapati was sometimes appointed by the provincial governor, and sometimes by the king directly¹³⁴.
- The districts were further subdivided into smaller units such as **vithis**, **bhumis**, **pathakas**, and **petas**. They were clusters of settlements that were administered by local officials such as **gramikas**, **mahattaras**, **ayuktakas**, and **pramatrakas**. They were in charge of maintaining the village records, collecting the land revenue, and resolving the disputes among the villagers⁴.

Some of the designations and functions of the officers in the provincial and district administration were:

- The **uparika** was the governor of the province. He was the representative of the king and had the authority to issue orders, grant lands, and appoint officials. He was assisted by a council of ministers and a staff of officers. He was also responsible for the defense and welfare of the province²⁴.
- The **vishayapati** was the head of the district. He was the chief revenue officer and the chief judicial officer. He was assisted by a board of five members, called the **panchala** or the **panchashila**. He also had a staff of clerks, accountants, and messengers. He was also in charge of the public works, such as roads, bridges, and irrigation¹³⁴.
- The **gramika** was the head of the village. He was elected by the villagers and was accountable to the vishayapati. He was responsible for maintaining the village records, such as the land register, the census, and the tax assessment. He also collected the land revenue and other dues from the villagers. He also acted as the judge in minor disputes and enforced the customary laws of the village⁴.
- The **mahattara** was the head of a group of villages. He was appointed by the vishayapati and was accountable to him. He was responsible for coordinating the activities of the gramikas and supervising the collection of revenue. He also acted as the mediator in disputes between the villages and reported the grievances of the villagers to the higher authorities⁴.
- The **ayuktaka** was the officer in charge of a vithi, a cluster of settlements. He was appointed by the vishayapati and was accountable to him. He was responsible for overseeing the administration of the vithi and ensuring the compliance of the villagers with the royal orders. He also acted as the liaison between the vishayapati and the gramikas⁴.
- The **pramatraka** was the officer in charge of a pathaka, a subdivision of a vithi. He was appointed by the ayuktaka and was accountable to him. He was responsible for inspecting the land, measuring the crops, and assessing the taxes. He also acted as the messenger and the spy for the ayuktaka⁴.

These are some of the provincial and district administrative units of the Gupta Empire with the designations and functions of the officers. I hope this information is helpful for you. 😊

```ad-Answer

The different sources for the study of Harshavardhana are:

- **Harshacharita**: It is a Sanskrit biography of Harshavardhana, written by Bana, his court poet. It describes his early life, his accession to the throne, his conquests, his patronage of arts and letters, and his religious activities. It also gives a vivid picture of the society and culture of his time¹².
- **Si-yu-ki**: It is a Chinese travelogue written by Hiuen Tsang, a Buddhist monk who visited India during Harshavardhana's reign. It gives a detailed account of the political, religious, social, and economic conditions of India, as well as the personal characteristics and achievements of Harshavardhana. It also records his interactions with other rulers, such as Pulakeshin II of the Chalukyas and Bhaskaravarman of the Kamarupa¹²⁴.
- **Harsha's own works**: Harshavardhana was also a prolific writer and dramatist. He composed three Sanskrit plays: Ratnavali, Nagananda, and Priyadarshika. These plays reflect his literary taste, his religious views, and his admiration for women. They also provide glimpses of the court life, the social customs, and the entertainment of his time¹².
- **Inscriptions**: There are a few inscriptions that mention Harshavardhana and his activities. The most important ones are the Madhuben plate inscription, the Sonpat inscription, and the Banskhera inscription. These inscriptions record his grants of land and donations to religious institutions, his titles and epithets, and his signature¹².

These sources can be critically examined as follows:

- The Harshacharita is a laudatory work that praises Harshavardhana and his family excessively. It also omits some important events, such as his defeat by Pulakeshin II and his death. It is not a reliable source for the chronological and factual details of his reign, but it is a valuable source for the literary and cultural aspects of his time².
- The Si-yu-ki is a more objective and reliable source than the Harshacharita, as it is based on the personal observations and experiences of Hiuen Tsang. However, it also has some limitations, such as the exaggeration of the size and extent of Harshavardhana's empire, the bias towards Buddhism and against Hinduism, and the lack of information on the southern and eastern regions of India. It is a useful source for the political and religious aspects of his time, but it is not a comprehensive source for the social and economic aspects of his time²⁴.
- Harsha's own works are not historical sources, but literary sources. They are not meant to provide factual information, but to entertain and instruct the audience. They are influenced by his personal preferences and opinions, and they may not reflect the reality of his time accurately. They are helpful sources for the understanding of his personality, his creativity, and his worldview, but they are not reliable sources for the history of his time².
- The inscriptions are authentic and authoritative sources, as they are issued by Harshavardhana himself or by his officials. They provide factual information on his grants, titles, and signature, which can be verified and corroborated by other sources. They are also useful sources for the study of his administration, his relations with other rulers, and his religious policy. However, they are also limited in scope and number, and they do not cover all the aspects of his reign².

![[Pasted image 20230216100043.png]]

Harsha is described as ‘the lord of the whole of north India’ because he built a large empire that covered most of the northern and northwestern regions of India. The extent of his empire can be determined through various sources, such as:

The Harshacharita: It is a biography of Harsha written by his court poet Bana. It narrates his conquests of various kingdoms and regions, such as Thanesar, Kannauj, Magadha, Bengal, Kamarupa, Kashmir, Sindh, Gujarat, Malwa, and Kosala. It also mentions his relations with other rulers, such as Pulakeshin II of the Chalukyas, Bhaskaravarman of the Kamarupa, and Shashanka of the Gauda12.

The Si-yu-ki: It is a travelogue of Hiuen Tsang, a Chinese Buddhist monk who visited India during Harsha’s reign. It describes the political, religious, and cultural conditions of Harsha’s empire, as well as his personal characteristics and achievements. It also records his interactions with other rulers, such as Pulakeshin II of the Chalukyas, Bhaskaravarman of the Kamarupa, and Shashanka of the Gauda. It also gives the size and extent of his empire, which he estimates to be about 5000 li (about 2000 km) from east to west and 4000 li (about 1600 km) from north to south12.

The inscriptions: There are a few inscriptions that mention Harsha and his activities, such as the Madhuben plate inscription, the Sonpat inscription, the Banskhera inscription, and the Harsha inscription. These inscriptions record his grants of land and donations to religious institutions, his titles and epithets, and his signature. They also provide information on his administration, his relations with other rulers, and his religious policy.

Sasanka: He was the king of Gauda (modern Bengal and Bihar) and an enemy of Harsha. He had killed Harsha’s brother Rajyavardhana, who had gone to rescue his sister Rajyashri the wife of Maukhari king Grahavarman, who was also killed by Sasanka. Harsha avenged his brother’s death by defeating Sasanka and annexing his territories. He also restored the Maukhari kingdom to his sister Rajyashri and her son Anandavardhana. Sasanka was also hostile to Buddhism and had cut down the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya. Harsha repaired the damage done by Sasanka and patronized Buddhism in his empire123.

Bhaskaravarman: He was the king of Kamarupa (modern Assam) and a friend of Harsha. He had helped Harsha in his wars against Sasanka and Pulakeshin II. He had also attended Harsha’s religious assemblies at Kannauj and Prayag, where he was honored by Harsha. He had exchanged gifts and embassies with Harsha and had also accompanied him to meet the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang. He was also a patron of Buddhism and had built many monasteries and stupas in his kingdom123.

Pulakeshin II: He was the king of the Chalukyas of Badami (modern Karnataka) and a rival of Harsha. He had resisted Harsha’s expansion in the south and had defeated him on the banks of the Narmada river. He had also sent an embassy to the Persian king Khosrow II, claiming to be the supreme lord of India. He had also patronized art, literature, and religion in his kingdom. He was later killed by the Pallavas of Kanchi, who had sacked his capital Badami123.

The statement that “Harsha owes his greatness largely not to any real achievements but to formulate descriptions by two famous men” is not entirely true. It is true that Harsha’s life and reign are mainly known from the accounts of two famous men, namely Bana and Hiuen Tsang, who were his contemporaries and admirers. Bana was his court poet, who wrote the Harshacharita, a biography of Harsha that praises his conquests, generosity, and virtues. Hiuen Tsang was a Chinese Buddhist monk, who visited India during Harsha’s reign and wrote the Si-yu-ki, a travelogue that describes the political, religious, and cultural conditions of Harsha’s empire, as well as his personal characteristics and achievements.

However, Harsha also had some real achievements that cannot be ignored or dismissed. He was a successful military leader, who unified most of northern India under his rule and resisted the expansion of the Chalukyas of Badami in the south. He was an able administrator, who maintained a well-organized and efficient government, a large and loyal army, and a prosperous and peaceful society. He was a patron of literature and art, who wrote three Sanskrit dramas, namely Nagananda, Ratnavali, and Priyadarshika, and supported many poets, scholars, and artists in his court. He was a tolerant and benevolent ruler, who patronized various religions, especially Buddhism, and held religious assemblies at Kannauj and Prayag, where he distributed gifts and donations to the needy and the learned. He was also a diplomat and a traveler, who exchanged embassies and gifts with other rulers, such as the Persian king Khosrow II, the Kamarupa king Bhaskaravarman, and the Chinese emperor Taizong. He also accompanied Hiuen Tsang to visit many holy places and monasteries in India

The Maukharis were a powerful dynasty that ruled over northern India from the 6th to the 7th century CE. They were instrumental in paving the way for the glory of Harshavardhana, one of the most celebrated rulers of ancient India.

The Maukharis rose to prominence under King Ishanavarman, who expanded his domain by defeating the Huns, the Guptas, and the Malavas. He also established friendly relations with the Later Guptas of Magadha and the Alchon Huns of Kabul. His son, Sarvavarman, consolidated the Maukhari power by marrying the Gupta princess Rajyashri, and by allying with the Pushyabhutis of Thanesar, who were also related to the Guptas.

The Maukharis reached their zenith under King Grahavarman, who ruled from 600 to 606 CE. He controlled a vast territory that stretched from the Himalayas to the Narmada river, and from the Punjab to Bihar. He was a patron of arts, literature, and religion, and supported the famous Buddhist university of Nalanda. He also maintained cordial ties with the Chinese emperor Yang Jian, who sent an envoy to his court.

However, Grahavarman's reign was cut short by the invasion of Shashanka, king of Gauda who defeated and killed him in 606 CE. Sasanka was a staunch Shaivite and a persecutor of Buddhism. He also attacked the Pushyabhutis of Thanesar, who were the allies and relatives of the Maukharis.

This was the turning point that paved the way for the glory of Harshavardhana, the son of Prabhakaravardhana, the Pushyabhuti king of Thanesar. Harshavardhana was only 16 years old when he ascended the throne in 606 CE, after the death of his father and his elder brother Rajyavardhana. He vowed to avenge the Maukharis and to restore their dignity. He also inherited the Maukhari kingdom through his sister Rajyashri, who was the widow of Grahavarman.

Harshavardhana embarked on a series of conquests that made him the paramount ruler of northern India. He defeated Sasanka and liberated the Maukhari territories from the Chalukya control. He also subdued the other regional powers, such as the Malavas, the Gurjaras, the Kosalas, and the Kalingas. He extended his sway over Nepal, Kashmir, Sindh, and parts of Central Asia. He established his capital at Kannauj, the former seat of the Maukharis, and made it a center of culture and learning.

Harshavardhana was also a benevolent and tolerant ruler, who patronized various religions, especially Buddhism. He was a friend and patron of the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, who visited his court and praised his achievements. He also convened the famous Kanauj Assembly, where he donated his wealth to the Buddhist sangha and declared himself a Mahayana Buddhist. He also organized the Kumbh Mela at Prayag, where he distributed alms to the poor and the needy.

Thus, the Maukharis paved the way for the glory of Harshavardhana, by creating a strong and prosperous kingdom that he inherited and expanded. They also provided him with a noble cause and a motivation to unify northern India and to promote peace and harmony among its people. The Maukharis and Harshavardhana together represent a golden age of Indian history, when culture, trade, and diplomacy flourished under their patronage.

Political leader: Harsha was a successful military leader, who unified most of northern India under his rule and resisted the expansion of the Chalukyas of Badami in the south. He ascended the throne at the age of 16, after the assassination of his brother and brother-in-law, who were the rulers of Thanesar and Kannauj respectively. He then avenged their deaths by defeating the king of Gauda, Sasanka, and conquering his territory. He also annexed Magadha, Bengal, Orissa, and parts of Nepal and Kashmir to his empire. He maintained friendly relations with other rulers, such as the Kamarupa king Bhaskaravarman, the Persian king Khosrow II, and the Chinese emperor Taizong. He also exchanged embassies and gifts with them. He was an able administrator, who maintained a well-organized and efficient government, a large and loyal army, and a prosperous and peaceful society. He was also a tolerant and benevolent ruler, who patronized various religions, especially Buddhism, and held religious assemblies at Kannauj and Prayag, where he distributed gifts and donations to the needy and the learned.

Cultural leader: Harsha was a patron of literature and art, who wrote three Sanskrit dramas, namely Nagananda, Ratnavali, and Priyadarshika, and supported many poets, scholars, and artists in his court. He also invited the Chinese Buddhist monk Hiuen Tsang to his court, who wrote a detailed account of Harsha’s empire and his personal characteristics and achievements. Harsha’s court poet Bana also wrote the Harshacharita, a biography of Harsha that praises his conquests, generosity, and virtues. Harsha also promoted the development of education, trade, and art in his empire. He supported the famous Nalanda University, where Hiuen Tsang studied and taught. He also encouraged trade and commerce with other countries, such as China, Persia, and Central Asia. He also patronized the art and architecture of his time, such as the Buddhist stupas, monasteries, and sculptures.

RC Majumdar : He has praised Harsha as a great conqueror, administrator, and patron of culture, but has also pointed out his limitations and failures, such as his inability to subdue the Chalukyas, his dependence on feudal allies, his lack of originality in literature, and his decline after his death. He has also challenged some of the exaggerated claims of Bana and Hiuen Tsang, such as the extent of Harsha’s empire, the size of his army, and the nature of his religious assemblies.

KM Panikkar : He has relied mainly on the accounts of Bana and Hiuen Tsang, and has portrayed Harsha as a great and glorious ruler, who unified most of India under his rule, and maintained peace and prosperity in his empire. He has also highlighted Harsha’s achievements in literature, art, religion, and diplomacy, and has compared him favorably with other contemporary rulers, such as the Persian king Khosrow II, the Chinese emperor Taizong, and the Byzantine emperor Heraclius. [He has also accepted some of the exaggerated claims of Bana and Hiuen Tsang, such as the extent of Harsha’s empire, the size of his army, and the nature of his religious assemblies.

Romila Thapar : She has argued that Harsha’s reign marked a transition from the ancient to the medieval period, when the political structure became more decentralized and feudal, and the social structure became more hierarchical and rigid. She has also discussed Harsha’s role in the development of literature, art, religion, and trade, and has compared him with other rulers of his time, such as the Chalukyas, the Pallavas, and the Kamarupa kings.

Lack of heirs: Harsha did not have any sons or daughters to succeed him, and his only brother and nephew were killed before him. Therefore, he did not have any legitimate or competent heirs to inherit his throne and his empire. This created a power vacuum and a succession crisis, which led to the collapse and disintegration of his empire into smaller states and principalities. His empire was largely dependent on his personal charisma and authority, and did not have a strong or stable political structure or administration to survive without him123.

Feudalism: Harsha had granted land in villages to his loyal supporters, such as his feudal allies, military officers, and religious institutions, in return for their services and tribute. This made the local landlords powerful and autonomous, and reduced the central control and revenue of the empire. This also led to the weakening of the empire and gave rise to local feuds and conflicts among the landlords and their rivals. Harsha had to be in constant movement to keep things in order and to deal with the external threats, such as the Chalukyas, the Huns, and the Tibetans. After his death, the feudal lords asserted their independence and refused to acknowledge any central authority or pay any tribute234.

Invasions: Harsha’s death also coincided with the rise of new invaders and enemies, who threatened the security and stability of northern India. The most prominent of these were the Arabs, who had conquered Persia and Central Asia, and had started to raid and attack the western and northwestern parts of India. They also tried to spread Islam in India, and challenged the existing religions and cultures. The Arabs were followed by the Turks, who also invaded and plundered India, and established their rule in some parts of the country. These invasions weakened the existing kingdoms and states, and disrupted the trade and commerce of the region

Comparison with death of Ashoka. Harshas death created a power vacuum and a succession crisis and rapid collapse.

The society in northern and central India since the death of Harsha to the Muslim conquest of North India was largely shaped by the various Rajput dynasties that emerged and ruled over different regions and kingdoms. The Rajputs were a group of warrior clans that claimed high descent from the ancient Kshatriyas or the solar and lunar races. They were proud of their martial prowess, loyalty, and chivalry, and often engaged in wars and alliances with each other and with other powers, such as the Turks, the Arabs, the Afghans, and the Chalukyas.

The Rajput society and culture were influenced by Hinduism, Jainism, Islam, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism, and reflected a diversity and richness of art, architecture, literature, music, dance, and cuisine. The Rajputs patronized temples, forts, palaces, gardens, sculptures, paintings, and coins, and developed styles and schools of their own, such as the Mewar, Marwar, Bundelkhand, and Kangra schools. The Rajputs also produced poets, historians, dramatists, and musicians, such as Chand Bardai, Jayasi, Somadeva, and Tansen. The Rajputs also followed customs and traditions, such as the jauhar, the saka, the sati, the gotra, and the agnikula, that reflected their values and beliefs.

However, the Rajput society and culture also suffered from some drawbacks and challenges, such as the lack of political unity and centralization, the wide discrepancy in living standards and social status, the rigid caste and creed systems, the frequent invasions and plunder by foreign enemies, and the decline of trade and commerce. The Rajput society and culture also underwent changes and adaptations, such as the adoption of Persian and Arabic languages and scripts, the conversion to Islam by some clans and rulers, the emergence of new sects and movements, such as the Bhakti and the Sufi, and the interaction and exchange with other civilizations, such as the Mughals, the Europeans, and the Chinese.
