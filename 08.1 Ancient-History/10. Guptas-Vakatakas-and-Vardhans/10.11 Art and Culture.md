- Late G - rep of human body became slender, poses more stylised
- > Joanna Williams - art had strong intellectual flavour, fine balance b/w representational credibility and abstracting tendencies
- >Walter Spink - Ajanta, Bagh, Dharashiva, Ghatotkacha, banoti Aurangabad caves testimony to fact that Vakatakas were last sponsors and guardians of golden age
