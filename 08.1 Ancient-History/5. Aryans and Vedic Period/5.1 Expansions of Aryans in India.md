The early Vedic Aryans lived in the area known as sapta-sindhu meaning area of seven rivers. This area largely covers the northwestern part of South Asia up to river Yamuna. The seven rivers included Sindhu, Vitasta (Jhelum), Asikni (Chenab), Parushni (Ravi), Vipash (Beas), Shutudri (Sutlej) and the Sarasvati. In this area the Rigvedic people lived, fought battles, grazed their herds of cattle and other domesticated animals. Gradually moving eastward, they came to occupy eastern U.P. (Kosala) and north Bihar (Videha) during the Later Vedic period. Here they came into contact with the people who spoke languages different from their own and were living in this area for long.[^1]

1. "Archaeology knows of no Aryans; only literature knows of Aryans." Examine critically.
[2015, 10m]

The term ‘Aryan’ is a contested one, with a complex history that has been used to refer to a range of different groups of people, from ancient Indo-Iranian peoples to those of the modern era. While the term is often used to refer to a racial or ethnic group, its meaning has been used in various ways throughout history. As such, it is not surprising that archaeology knows of no Aryans, as the term has been used in different contexts throughout history.

In its most common usage, the term ‘Aryan’ is used to refer to a group of people who are thought to have originated in the Indian subcontinent, spreading out to other parts of the world. This group is often associated with the Indo-European language family and is thought to have played an important role in the development of many of the world’s major religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. However, there is no archaeological evidence to support this theory. While there is evidence of a migration of people from the Indian subcontinent to other parts of the world, there is no evidence to suggest that this migration was related to the development of any particular religion or language.

The term ‘Aryan’ has also been used to refer to a group of people who are thought to have originated in Central Asia, and who were responsible for the spread of the Indo-European language family to Europe. This theory is based largely on linguistic evidence, as there is no archaeological evidence to support it. Similarly, the term has been used to refer to a group of people who are thought to have originated in the Middle East and who are responsible for the spread of the Semitic languages to Europe. Again, there is no archaeological evidence to support this theory.

Finally, the term ‘Aryan’ has been used in literature to refer to a race of people who are thought to be superior to other races. This idea has been used in various works of fiction, such as J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, and is often associated with Nazi ideology. However, this is not an idea that is supported by archaeological evidence, and is instead a literary construct.

In conclusion, it is accurate to say that archaeology knows of no Aryans, as the term has been used in different contexts throughout history and has no archaeological basis. While there is evidence of migrations of people from the Indian subcontinent to other parts of the world, as well as evidence of the spread of the Indo-European language family, there is no evidence to suggest that these migrations or languages are related to any particular ethnic or racial group. Similarly, the idea of an Aryan race is a literary construct, and is not supported by archaeological evidence.
