The Early Vedic period, also known as the Rigvedic period, is characterized by a relatively egalitarian society, where individuals were free to pursue their own goals and where social distinctions were based on merit rather than birth. It was also marked by absence of Gender based discrimination and Women enjoyed a significant postion in society. On the other hand, the Later Vedic period, which is marked by the emergence of the other three Vedas, the society underwent significant changes and the egalitarian character of the early Vedic society was altered.

One of the main elements of continuity between the Early and Later Vedic cultures is the presence of the Vedic religion. The Vedic religion, which is based on the worship of natural forces and elements, remained a fundamental aspect of both societies. However, during the Later Vedic period, there was an evolution of religious beliefs and practices, with the emergence of a more complex pantheon of gods and goddesses, and the introduction of new religious practices such as the use of fire sacrifices and the performance of elaborate rituals.

Another element of continuity is the presence of the Vedas themselves, which remained an important source of religious and cultural knowledge throughout both periods. The Vedas were considered sacred texts and were passed down from generation to generation.

In terms of changes, one of the main elements of change between the Early and Later Vedic cultures is the emergence of a caste system. The Rigveda makes no mention of caste distinctions, but by the time of the later Vedas, the caste system had become an integral part of society. This system was based on the belief that individuals were born into a certain caste based on the actions of their ancestors and that they were destined to remain in that caste for their entire lives. This change in society's organization was reflected in the religious texts of later Vedic period, where the Brahmins, who were the priests and scholars, came to hold a position of great prestige and power.

As far as the varna division are concerned, they became entrenched into religion. The four fold varna system with the Brahmanas on top was soldified as more religious texts were written during the time. This varna division was rigid and based on birth. 

Another significant change was the emergence of a powerful and centralized state. The early Vedic society was primarily made up of small, autonomous villages, but during the later Vedic period, large kingdoms and empires emerged. This is reflected in the later Vedas, which contain references to powerful kings and their armies, as well as to large cities and urban centers. The kings were often seen as divine figures, and the state became an important religious institution. This change in political organization led to the emergence of a ruling class, which came to hold significant power and wealth. 

Cattle raids now became full fledged wars as the Rulers and the ruled became more conscious about the territory they lived in. Concept of private property started to develop.

```ad-Answer

The Indus Valley and Vedic cultures are two of the oldest and most important civilizations in the Indian subcontinent. The Indus Valley civilization was the first major urban civilization in the region and flourished between 2600 and 1900 BC. The Vedic culture was the culture of the Vedic period in India, which lasted from roughly 1500 to 500 BC. Both cultures had a significant impact on the development of Indian culture, society, and religion.

The most striking difference between the Indus Valley and Vedic cultures is their geographical locations. The Indus Valley civilization was centered in the Indus Valley, which is now in Pakistan, while the Vedic culture was largely centered in the Gangetic Plain in northern India. This difference in location is reflected in the different cultural influences that each civilization had. The Indus Valley civilization was heavily influenced by the Mesopotamian and Persian cultures, while the Vedic culture was heavily influenced by the cultures of the Central Asian steppes.

Another major difference between the two cultures is their religious beliefs. The Indus Valley civilization is believed to have had a polytheistic religion, with many gods and goddesses associated with different aspects of nature. The Vedic culture, on the other hand, had a more organized religion, centered around the worship of a single god, Brahman. This single god was believed to be the creator of the universe and was worshipped through rituals and sacrifices.

Despite these differences, the Indus Valley and Vedic cultures also had many similarities. Both cultures were highly stratified, with a strong emphasis on caste and class. Both cultures also had a strong agricultural base, with a focus on the cultivation of wheat, barley, and other grains. Additionally, both cultures had a strong social and political structure, with kings and rulers at the top of the hierarchy.

Both cultures also had a strong emphasis on art and literature. The Indus Valley civilization is known for its elaborate seals and sculptures, while the Vedic culture is known for its hymns and religious texts. Both cultures also had a strong emphasis on education, with a focus on the study of mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy.

Finally, both cultures had a strong influence on the development of Indian culture and religion. The Indus Valley civilization is believed to have had a major influence on the development of Hinduism, while the Vedic culture is credited with the development of the Vedic religion and the development of the Upanishads, which are considered to be the foundation of Hinduism.

Overall, the Indus Valley and Vedic cultures had many differences and similarities. Despite their different geographical locations and religious beliefs, both cultures had a major influence on the development of Indian culture, society, and religion.
