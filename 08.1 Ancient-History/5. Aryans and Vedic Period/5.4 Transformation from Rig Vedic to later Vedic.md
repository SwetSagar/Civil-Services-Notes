```ad-Answer

The early Vedic society was characterized by a relatively egalitarian social structure, with a simple division of society into various classes, including priests, warriors, and commoners. However, as the Vedic period progressed, this simple social structure became more complex, leading to a significant shift in the egalitarian character of Vedic society.

One of the major changes was the emergence of a strong caste system, which divided society into four main castes: Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (traders), and Shudras (servants). This system placed great importance on birth, with individuals inheriting their caste status from their parents. This hierarchical structure reduced social mobility and reinforced the distinctions between castes, making it more difficult for individuals to move between them.

Another factor that contributed to the shift away from equality in Vedic society was the emergence of a powerful landed aristocracy. This group of wealthy landowners controlled much of the land and wealth in the society, which gave them significant economic and political power. The increasing wealth and power of this group helped to reinforce the caste system, as they used their resources to maintain their position at the top of the social hierarchy.

The changing economic conditions of the later Vedic period also contributed to the shift away from equality. As the population grew and resources became scarcer, the competition for land and resources intensified. This led to the growth of a merchant class, which further reinforced the caste system and created new economic and social inequalities.

The changing religious beliefs of the later Vedic period also contributed to the shift away from equality. The early Vedic religion was based on a simple, nature-based pantheon of gods, but as the period progressed, the religion became more complex, with the addition of new gods and rituals. This growing complexity reinforced the importance of the priests, who held a monopoly on religious knowledge and controlled access to the gods. The priests used this power to maintain their position at the top of the social hierarchy, further reinforcing the caste system.
