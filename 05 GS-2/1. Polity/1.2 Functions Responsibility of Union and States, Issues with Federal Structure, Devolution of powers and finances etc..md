```ad-Answer

-   14th Finance Commission (FFC) was constituted by the President in 2013 for the period of 2015-2020
-   It was tasked with recommending the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Centre and the States
-   FFC increased the States' share in the central taxes from 32% to 42%
-   The total devolution to States was increased from Rs. 3.48 lakh crore in 2014-15 to Rs. 7.61 lakh crore in 2019-20
-   States now have greater autonomy in designing and implementing their own development programmes
-   The increased fiscal space has allowed the States to fund infrastructure projects, social welfare schemes, and public services
-   FFC has also recommended a fiscal roadmap for States, with an emphasis on debt sustainability and fiscal discipline
-   States are required to follow a set of fiscal rules and reporting mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability in their financial management
-   The recommendations of FFC have helped in addressing the vertical fiscal imbalance and strengthening the federal structure of India.
