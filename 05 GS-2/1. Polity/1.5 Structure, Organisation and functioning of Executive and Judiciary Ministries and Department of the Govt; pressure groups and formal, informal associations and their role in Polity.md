The Executive

|     Instances of   President’s delay in commuting death sentences has come under public debate   as denial of justice. Should there be a time limit specified for the   President to accept/reject such petitions? Analyse.                                 |     2014    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|     The size of the   cabinet should be as big as governmental work justifies and as big as the   Prime Minister can manage as a team. How far the efficacy of a government   then is inversely related to the size of the cabinet? Discuss.                |     2014    |

1. The size of the cabinet should be as big as governmental work justifies and as big as the Prime Minister can manage as a team. How far the efficacy of a government then is inversely related to the size of the cabinet? Discuss.
