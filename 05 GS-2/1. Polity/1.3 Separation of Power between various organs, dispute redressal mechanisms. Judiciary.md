## Issues with Supreme Court viz Collegium, Pendancy etc.
2019-05-12 14:50 :38

---

### Collegium System:

- Headed by CJI + 4 SC Judges
- Recommendations binding to gov if the Collegium sends the names of the judges/lawyers to the government for 2 nd time
- No time limit to reply -> Hence appointment takes long time
- Central gov does fact checking
- No mention in constitution
- Consesus required for appointment

![[Supreme-Court-Collegium-image1-23205818.jpg]]

#### **Gender disparity in Collegium/ Judiciary**

- SC has had only 8 female judges / 239
- Low f judges in subordinate judiciary
- Only 1 women collegium member so far no female CJI.

#### Too Few SC Judges Issues

- Supreme Court Judge strength inc from 31 to 34, to deal with paucity of judges
- Increase in the SCs strength may not be enough.
- Require :
    - Restraint the duration of oral arguments.
    - Adherence to schedule of hearings.
    - preserve the apex court's primary role as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional questions and statutory interpretation [Article 145(3)](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/244297/).
- **229 th Law Commission Reoport** : one Constitution Bench in Delhi, and four '*Cassation Benches* these will be final appellate courts for routine litigation.
- Article 124 appointments are made by Prez, judge must be advocate in HC >= 10 years or have held judicial office for 10 years.

### '**In-house procedure**' of SC

- keeps outside agency out, maintains independence of Judiciary and faith of people.
- 3 bench committee 2 HC CJs, 1 HC judge no lawyer involved similar for SC judge
- Recusal of mem cannot be demanded by the litigant and reason for recusal given in writing.
- If convicted -> Removal Jude/Impeachment

### Fast Track Courts FTC

- FTCs are set up by State Govt in consulation with High Courts recommended by 11th finance commission.
- FTCs now to clear the cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act :
- 581 FTCs operational 5.9 lakh pending cases.
- Districts with more than 100 cases pending need to make FTCs.
- Issues :
	- Decline of FTCs variation in kinds of cases handled,
	- Lacked technological resources
	- Inadequate staff
	- Delay in getting reports, adjournments
	- Over-listing of cases
- Needs :
	- Identifying systemic issues and addressing the concerns,
	- Equal attention must be paid to metropolitan and far-flung non-metropolitan areas.
	- States will need to take stock of the issues at the ground level

### Judges Cases

The primary question was the meaning of term 'in consultation' mentioned in Art 124 and 222.

- **1 st Judges case 1981**: 7 judge bench *reaffirmed that consultation does not mean concurrence* that was laid down before in Sankalchand Case. And transfers must be in national interest after consulting CJI.
	- During this time Transfers were made by the President acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
	- The case thus gave Executive's decision primacy of CJI's.
- Supreme Court Advocates on record case aka **2 nd Judges case** 1993
	- '*Consultation Really meant concurrence*' this consultary opinion of CJI was to be formed along w/ 2 senior most Judges of SC.
	- Thus ==introduced Collegium system==.
	- Said CJI has not only primacy but is determinative.
	- Views of Transfered judge should be given in writing.
- **3 rd Judges case 1998**
	- Expanded collegium to 5 mem body.
	- CJI was to consult CJ of HC and HC where judge was to be transferred whose views were to be given in writing.
	- Judge to be transferred could put his views in front of CJI.
- **4 th Judges case**
	- NJAC (99 th Amendment) quashed in 2015.
- **255th Law Commission** #Report, 2nd ARC, Justice Tarkunde #Committee recommended a ==Collegium system== for the appointment of CEC and EC.

### **Appointment of CJI** 

- : not in Const, given in Memorandum of Procedure MoP b/w gov and judiciary.
- Procedure : Law Ministry seeks recom from outgoing CJI -> CJI sends name can consult collegium -> law minister forwards to PM who advices the Prez to make appointment.
- Except for law min seeking name there is no say of gov, cannot send recom back.

### Recent Supreme Court Rulings

- Recently divorce was given by SC exercising special powers under Art 142 for '*irretrievable breakdown of marriage*' such a case has not been described under the Hindu Marriage Act 1955.

- Summer Vacation declared by CJI
	- Summer bench constituted by CJI special bench,
	- Not fully closed, only special matters to be taken
	- Admits writ.

- **Mullaperiyar dam issue** : SC asked supervisory committee to take decision on max level that can be maintained at the dam. Kerala wants lower max level but TN wants more since it operates the dam despite the dam itself being in Kerala -> to help Madurai farmers but this make Idukki district prone to floods .

- Tenure of CBI director and ED Chief (amending CVC 2003 Act) was increased by 2 years upto 5 years.

- SC said that courts cannot interfere with day to day rituals and sevas performed in temples on basis of 'public interest' petitions.

	- **SS Shukla case** 1976 during emergency SC said citizen loses his right to move to court under Art 32. But it is on the discretion of SC and each individual judge to decide to take on the case.
- National Court of Appeals suggested by AG of India to act as final court of justice dealing with appeals from HC and tribunals within their region.
